- We're in a dimly lit chamber in a subterranean temple on [[world.places.korriban.md]]
  - Six statues
  - Walkway in the middle, door on one end, dais on the other
    - (*Dais ex machina*)
  - We approach the dais
- Approach the dais
  - [[Zev|characters.zevid-tor.md]] investigation check: Is this place structurally sound?
    - Looks ok
  - Ghost shows up
  - Fate or misfortune?
  - Other unsavory tenants?
  - This place is a test to join their order
  - What's the order? [[world.factions.the-gray.md]]
  - What do you do? That's the correct answer
  - Ghost: [["Kur-bann"|world.places.korriban.md]] (*sic*) was not always inherently evil, nor its people...[toxic love britney]....
  - [[world.objects.holocron]] lights up on the dais
    - Ghost: The power runs low...take it places... if the correct questions and correct place speak again
- [[Tarn|characters.tarnosian-snee.md]] investigates the walls... finds text
  - no light w/o dark, passion => focus, knowledge => power, serenity => strength, victory => harmony, there is only the force
- [[characters.r3-d0]] investigate the statues... they look the same, they have robes like the ghost
  - basic human faces
- Bust open the door
  - Zombie spider things
    - Fungus zombies
    - Run along the wall, avoiding the oil (gadamn)
    - [[Tarn|characters.tarnosian-snee.md]] and [[Zev|characters.zevid-tor.md]] shatter the first one
    - Second one injured
    - [[characters.r3-d0]] zap it to death
- We long rest and [[characters.r3-d0]] install mods
- Go into next room
  - Zerg stuff on the floor
  - [[Tarn|characters.tarnosian-snee.md]] notices small statues in the room
  - We go to next room
  - [[Tarn|characters.tarnosian-snee.md]] saunters in
  - [[Zev|characters.zevid-tor.md]] has darkvision, oops
  - [[Zev|characters.zevid-tor.md]] goes in; those things are everywhere
  - Combat
  - We fight a lot of things
  - We do the cool thing where [[characters.r3-d0]] oil slicked and then [[Zev|characters.zevid-tor.md]] ignited it
- Next room, columns lined, table in middle with light shining on it
  - metal cylinder
  - it has buttons
  - couldn't make it work
- Go to next room
  - Ridiculous dark jedi thing
  - [[characters.r3-d0]] almost die
  - We survive
  - [[characters.r3-d0]] take a finger bone[[world.objects.finger-bone.md]] from the skeleton
- We go to next room... daylight
  - Emerge into a gorge
  - Go into hanger
  - See medium freighter
  - All the shit with the [[world.ships.the-ebon-hawk]]
- Addendum 01-07-2023:
  - We eventually got out with the ship
  - There was a weird blackout thing
  - [[characters.r3-d0]] told the AI that they were captain and [[Zev|characters.zevid-tor]] the pilot.
  - Does [[characters.r3-d0]] still have the cylinder?
