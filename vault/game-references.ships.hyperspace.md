#### Astrogation

Plotting a hyperspace course requires incredibly difficult calculations. Before jumping to hyperspace, a ship must plot a course via astrogation by completing 10 astrogation equations. When not under stress, a crewmember can take 10 minutes to carefully make these calculations and check them, resulting in automatic success. When under duress, such as in combat situations, a crewmember can calculate astronavigation with an Intelligence (Astrogation) check as an action on their turn, and then consults the **Astrogation Results** table.

| d20 | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 9 or lower | Your calculations fail, resulting in no completed equations. |
| 10-15 | Your calculations are adequate, resulting in one completed equation. |
| 16-20 | Your calculations include a breakthrough, resulting in two completed equations. |
| 21-25 | Your calculations are excellent, resulting in three completed equations. |
| 26-29 | Your calculations are masterful, resulting in four completed equations. |
| 30+ | Your calculations are perfect, resulting in five completed equations. |

Additionally, the accuracy of the check is affected by how old the astrogation information is. If the astrogation information is less than a day old, the operator has advantage on the check. If the information is older than a week, however, they have disadvantage on the check.

You may choose to penalize your Intelligence (Astrogation) checks by 5 before making them in order to reduce your travel time by 24 hours; if this would reduce the travel time to less than 24 hours, you instead reduce the remaining travel time by one-half, to a minimum of 1 hour. You must restart your calculations if you change this course choice.

Alternatively, you may gain a +5 circumstance bonus on your Intelligence (Astrogation) checks if you voluntarily double the travel time.

A jump to hyperspace can always be rushed, being made before all ten equations are completed, but such travel can be incredibly dangerous. If a starship is disabled because of a poorly plotted hyperspace course, the GM usually chooses the point at which the ship drops out of hyperspace at random. GMs looking for a more in-depth description of a hyperspace mishap can consult the table below. For every complete equation, add 1 to your roll on the table below. If you roll a 1 on your die, you roll again on the table in addition to suffering the indicated penalty. If you make a jump without *any* calculations and roll a 20, your ship comes out of hyperspace unscathed, but in a completely unknown location.

When a starship enters or exits hyperspace, it generates a short burst of Cronau radiation. Any facility with adequate sensor arrays can detect this radiation burst with a DC 20 Wisdom (Scan) check. Success would indicate that a ship entered or exited the system as well as the point of arrival or departure. With a successful Intelligence (Probe) check (DC 25), the angle of departure can be determined, indicating possible destinations.

| D20 | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 20+ | The ship suffers no adverse consequences. |
| 18-19 | The ship encounters dumped cargo, setting off a collision alarm. The ship must make a DC 15 Constitution save. On a failure, the ship takes 3 hull dice of damage; the ship takes half damage on a suc-cess. The cargo is salvageable, it consists of 10d10 tons of cargo, each with a value of 10d10x10 credits. |
| 15-17 | The ship passes through an uncharted dust cloud, clogging sensors and communications equipment. Scan and Probe checks aboard the ship are made with disadvantage until the ship is refitted. |
| 12-14 | The ship passes too close to a supernova, overloading computer systems with solar radiation. Intelligence checks aboard the ship have disadvantage until the ship is refitted. |
| 9-11 | The ship passes through an unexpected gravity field, causing structural stress. Maneuver checks are made with disadvantage until the ship is refitted. |
| 6-8 | Intense gravity warps the vessel’s structural integrity. The ship’s AC is reduced by 2 until the ship is refitted. |
| 3-5 | The ship collides with significant debris, its hull immediately taking kinetic damage equal to one-tenth of its max HP, and shields regenerate at half their normal rate until the ship is refitted. |
| 1-2 | The hyperdrive suffers a catastrophic failure, and is rendered unusable until the ship is refitted. |

> **The BoSS:** In addition to their duties of regulating information regarding ship ownership, the BoSS also maintains a database of astrogation information. Each time a ship docks in a major spaceport, they can update their astrogation data for a 150 credit fee. Astrogation data is routinely updated and is rarely more than a week old.
