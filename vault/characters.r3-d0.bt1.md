"*All this effort for a simple astromech?*"
"*Not exactly. This is BT-1, a "Blastomech" prototype. Does enough to pass as an astro, but it's primarily a cover. It's a specialized assassin droid.*"

BT-1 escapes the destroyed Tarkin Initiative base

BT-1 was designed to look like an [astromech droid](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Astromech_droid "Astromech droid") in order to fool others, and was armed with a variety of weapons. He [killed](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Death "Death") the staff of the [Tarkin Initiative base](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tarkin_Initiative_base "Tarkin Initiative base") in which he was created and then continued to set the base to self-destruct before jettisoning himself into space. He was found by the rogue [archaeologist](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Archaeologist "Archaeologist") [Doctor](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Doctor "Doctor") [Aphra](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Chelli_Lona_Aphra "Chelli Lona Aphra"), who could not reactivate the [assassin droid](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Assassin_droid "Assassin droid") as she could not speak the [R&D language](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/R%26D_language "R&D language") the droid was programmed to understand. After Aphra reactivated the [protocol droid](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Protocol_droid "Protocol droid") [0-0-0](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/0-0-0 "0-0-0"), a droid capable of understanding the language, she had the protocol droid reactivate BT-1. Instead of giving the two droids to the [Droid Gotra](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Droid_Gotra "Droid Gotra"), as she had originally been hired to do, the archaeologist put them in the service of [Sith Lord](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Lord "Sith Lord") [Darth Vader](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker "Anakin Skywalker"), who had tracked Aphra down to demand her services in creating a personal army for himself.<sup id="cite_ref-DV3_3-11"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-DV3-3">[3]</a></sup>

### Serving Darth Vader\[\]

#### Cylo-V's replacements\[\]

BT-1 accompanied Aphra and Vader, together with 0-0-0, for their mission on [Geonosis](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Geonosis "Geonosis"), where Aphra had heard of a Geonosian queen who was in control of a droid factory. The four invaded the queen's factory, stole the machine that constructed droids and quickly escaped. Not much later, a [bounty hunter](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bounty_hunter "Bounty hunter") that Darth Vader had earlier hired, [Krrsantan](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Krrsantan "Krrsantan") arrived, with [Cylo-IV](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cylo "Cylo"), a person who Vader was suspicious of. Vader ordered 0-0-0 to interrogate Cylo-IV and when 0-0-0 believed that he had extracted all information he could, he killed him. 0-0-0 told Vader that Cylo-IV was training [the Emperor's](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Sidious "Darth Sidious") possible future replacements for Vader and the Dark Lord set course for [Cylo-IV's research base](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cylo%27s_research_base "Cylo's research base").<sup id="cite_ref-DV4_6-1"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-DV4-6">[6]</a></sup>

To start off his attack, Vader sent BT-1 and 0-0-0 into the base as distractions. He then proceeded to attack Cylo-IV's men from behind, with his small army of droids. As he continued into the base, Vader found two twin humans, one [male](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Gender "Gender") and one female. The twins attacked him, using [lightsabers](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber "Lightsaber"), however it was clear to Vader that they weren't [Force-sensitive](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Force-sensitive "Force-sensitive"). After a quick fight, the two humans were told to stop by Cylo-IV, who revealed that he was an immortal system that switched to a new body as soon as the previous was destroyed and that his current body was called Cylo-V.<sup id="cite_ref-Vader_5_5-1"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-Vader_5-5">[5]</a></sup>

Cylo-V introduced his replacements for Vader and as Vader was about to strike Cylo down, the Emperor revealed himself to be in their presence and asked to see what Cylo's replacements were capable of.<sup id="cite_ref-Vader_5_5-2"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-Vader_5-5">[5]</a></sup> Cylo started by showing off the twins from before, named [Aiolin](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Aiolin_Astarte "Aiolin Astarte") and [Morit Astarte](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Morit_Astarte "Morit Astarte"). He continued to show the rest of his warriors, until he decided to show their abilities by having them all fight each other to the death. Vader started by fighting against an [enhanced Trandoshan](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Unidentified_Trandoshan_(Cylo-V%27s_warrior) "Unidentified Trandoshan (Cylo-V's warrior)"), but in the middle of their fight, Morit killed the Trandoshan. Sidious stopped the fighting, wanting to use them against his own enemies instead of each other. Vader left Cylo's research station and waited for [Boba Fett](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Boba_Fett "Boba Fett"), the bounty hunter he had hired to find the person responsible for destroying the [Death Star](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/DS-1_Death_Star_Mobile_Battle_Station "DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station"). Fett told Vader that he had found the person and that the two briefly fought, with the latter winning. Fett had figured out that the person was named [Luke Skywalker](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Luke_Skywalker "Luke Skywalker").<sup id="cite_ref-DV6_9-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-DV6-9">[9]</a></sup>

#### Vader's son\[\]

Sometime later, Vader instructed Aphra to join up with a group of bounty hunters and plunder an Imperial ship for credits. After sharing the credits between each other, the bounty hunters parted ways.<sup id="cite_ref-DV8_10-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-DV8-10">[10]</a></sup> Vader then sent Aphra to retrieve information on [Commodex Tahn](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Commodex_Tahn "Commodex Tahn"), the person who buried [Padmé Amidala](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala "Padmé Amidala"), as Vader wanted to confirm that Padmé gave birth to Vader's son before dying. Aphra, 0-0-0 and BT-1 went to [The Ante](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_Ante "The Ante") an [information broker](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Information_broker "Information broker"), on the [Spire](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Anthan_Spire "Anthan Spire"), who after being paid a large amount of credits, gave the three information about Tahn, including the fact that he lived on [Naboo](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Naboo "Naboo").<sup id="cite_ref-DV9_11-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-DV9-11">[11]</a></sup> Thereafter, they [attacked](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Assault_on_Commodex_Tahn%27s_villa "Assault on Commodex Tahn's villa") Tahn's home with some of Vader's droids and then subsequently tortured and interrogated Tahn, until he confirmed that Padmé had indeed given birth to a boy, after which 0-0-0 killed him.<sup id="cite_ref-DV10_12-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-DV10-12">[12]</a></sup>

0-0-0 and BT-1 lose a game of holochess

Aphra, 0-0-0 and BT-1 soon returned to the Ante, seeking information on Luke Skywalker's location, while BT-1 and 0-0-0 went to play [holochess](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dejarik "Dejarik"). The Ante quickly figured out that Aphra was one of the plunderers of the Imperial ship carrying credits, after seeing the amount of credits she was ready to give, but still gave the location of Luke. The Spire was soon attacked by Imperials who believed that one of the plunderers were there. After quickly interrogating the Ante, the Imperials learned that Aphra was one of the plunderers from before. Aphra, BT-1 and 0-0-0 escaped the Spire, before finding themselves locked in by an Imperial blockade.<sup id="cite_ref-DV11_13-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-DV11-13">[13]</a></sup>

Darth Vader, who was on one of the blockade ship and could not reveal that he was working with Aphra, was able to convince [Inspector](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Inspector "Inspector") [Thanoth](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Thanoth "Thanoth") that they were wasting their time chasing a thief, when they could instead attack the recently discovered base of a [Rebel Alliance](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Alliance_to_Restore_the_Republic "Alliance to Restore the Republic") squadron. With the blockade gone, Aphra met up with Vader again and told him that Luke was located on [Vrogas Vas](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vrogas_Vas "Vrogas Vas").<sup id="cite_ref-DV12_14-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-DV12-14">[14]</a></sup>

Before finding Luke, Vader took BT-1 and 0-0-0 with him to ore-rich planet of [Shu-Torun](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Shu-Torun "Shu-Torun"), where both the [ore-dukes](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ore-duke "Ore-duke") and the ruling family were slowly rebelling against the Imperial control. While Vader was taken to a celebration party with [Princess](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Prince "Prince") [Trios](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Trios "Trios"), the two droids went to assassinate the king and his servants. When Vader and Trios found the dead bodies, Vader informed Trios that from now on, she would become the Queen of Shu-Torun and warned her that if the planet kept resisting the Empire, consequences would follow.<sup id="cite_ref-DVA1_15-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-DVA1-15">[15]</a></sup> Vader then sent BT-1 and 0-0-0 back to Aphra, while he set course for Vrogas Vas.<sup id="cite_ref-VD1_16-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-VD1-16">[16]</a></sup>

Vader kept contact with Aphra as he arrived above the planet, but not soon after arriving, he was attacked by Rebel Alliance ships. Aphra listened as Vader's ship crashed and decided to go and save Vader, with 0-0-0 and BT-1.<sup id="cite_ref-VD1_16-1"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-VD1-16">[16]</a></sup> After landing on the planet, they found Luke Skywalker and his astromech droid [R2-D2](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/R2-D2 "R2-D2"). In order to trick Luke, Aphra painted 0-0-0 [yellow](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Color "Color") and tricked Luke into believing that he was [C-3PO](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/C-3PO "C-3PO"), one of Luke's allies. 0-0-0 was able to get near Luke and shock him with electricity, making him fall unconscious.<sup id="cite_ref-DV13_17-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-DV13-17">[17]</a></sup> When he saw that he stood no chance against BT-1, R2 ran away, with BT-1 not far behind, following him.<sup id="cite_ref-SW13_18-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-SW13-18">[18]</a></sup>

Aphra and 0-0-0 were eventually found by [Han Solo](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Han_Solo "Han Solo") and [Chewbacca](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Chewbacca "Chewbacca") who demanded they let Luke go. A fight between the four broke out, while Luke was still unconscious. R2 soon found Luke again, who was now conscious and the two outran BT-1. BT-1 then regrouped with 0-0-0, who had lost both his arms, one pulled off by Chewbacca, one by Luke and found that Aphra had fallen unconscious in the fight against Han.<sup id="cite_ref-SW13_18-1"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-SW13-18">[18]</a></sup>

The two droids got ready to eradicate Luke, Chewbacca, Han, and R2, but as BT-1 got his weapons ready, R2 sprayed oil on him, blinding BT and resulting in him shooting everywhere, giving time for the others to escape and trapping the two droids under rubble.<sup id="cite_ref-SW13_18-2"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-SW13-18">[18]</a></sup> As soon as Aphra woke up, she helped the droids out of the rubble and ordered the droids to find and secretly follow Luke. The two soon found C-3PO, whose arms 0-0-0 took, reattached on himself and left him.<sup id="cite_ref-DV14_19-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-DV14-19">[19]</a></sup>

#### Arrival of General Karbin\[\]

When 0-0-0 and BT found Luke, they saw that he was fighting Imperial troops and deduced that Vader was not near, as the Sith Lord was operating alone. They were then contacted by Aphra who told them that [General](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/General "General") [Karbin](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Karbin "Karbin"), one of Cylo-V's replacements for Vader, had arrived on the planet to capture Luke for himself. Aphra told the droids to protect Luke from the Imperial troops in any way possible.<sup id="cite_ref-SW14_20-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-SW14-20">[20]</a></sup> Their protection wasn't enough, as Luke was captured by Karbin anyway.<sup id="cite_ref-DV15_21-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-DV15-21">[21]</a></sup>

Luke was taken aboard Karbin's ship, as Vader watched it fly away. Not wanting to accept Karbin's victory, Vader used [the Force](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force "The Force") to crash the ship. Luke was found again by Han, Chewbacca, R2, and 3PO, before the group was approached by Aphra, who informed the group that they were standing on a minefield and threatened to kill them all if they didn't allow themselves to be captured. As they began dropping their weapons, [Leia](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Leia_Skywalker_Organa_Solo "Leia Skywalker Organa Solo") knocked Aphra unconscious from behind. The rebels took Aphra with them on their ship and left the planet.<sup id="cite_ref-DV15_21-1"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-DV15-21">[21]</a></sup>

#### Further trouble on Shu-Torun\[\]

After delivering Karbin's dead body to his master, Vader was ordered to accompany Cylo-V and his warriors for their return to Shu-Torun, after the resistance on the planet became too unbearable. After arriving on the planet, Vader met with bounty hunters Black Krrsantan, [Zuckuss](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Zuckuss "Zuckuss"), [IG-90](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/IG-90 "IG-90"), [Dengar](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dengar "Dengar"), [Chanath Cha](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Chanath_Cha "Chanath Cha"), [Beebox](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Beebox "Beebox"), and [C-21 Highsinger](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/C-21_Highsinger "C-21 Highsinger") and told them to find and return Dr. Aphra to him.<sup id="cite_ref-DV16_22-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-DV16-22">[22]</a></sup>

Not much time went by before Beebox returned to Vader with a disintegrated body, claiming that he had killed her, however Vader quickly saw through Beebox's lie and killed him for it.<sup id="cite_ref-DV17_23-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-DV17-23">[23]</a></sup> While Vader was away, 0-0-0 and BT-1 gave some of Vader's droids the ability to leech blood, despite Vader's orders not to. The droids used this ability in their battle against [Baron](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Baron "Baron") [Rubix](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rubix "Rubix")'s soldiers, easily making their foes surrender out of fear. Vader soon learned of the two droids' actions, but had no time to care, as he had to use this chance to attack [Rubix's citadel](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rubix%27s_delving_citadel "Rubix's delving citadel"). After the execution of Rubix, Vader and his droids left it up to Queen Trios to defeat the now-weakened rebellion on the planet. Arriving back on a Star Destroyer, Vader explained to his two droids that before the attack on Rubix's citadel, Vader had been attacked by Cylo-V's two twin warriors, Aiolin and Morit, and that Morit had killed Aiolin in the fight. He also told the two that Cylo-V and the rest of his warriors had revealed themselves to be traitors, as they had aided the ore-dukes.<sup id="cite_ref-DV19_24-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-DV19-24">[24]</a></sup>

### Traveling with Aphra\[\]

#### Stealing the Sword of Khashyun\[\]

BT-1 was with 0-0-0 and Chelli Aphra when she met [Hondo Ohnaka](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hondo_Ohnaka "Hondo Ohnaka") to arrange the theft and transport of the [Sword of Khashyun](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sword_of_Khashyun "Sword of Khashyun").<sup id="cite_ref-Edge3_25-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-Edge3-25">[25]</a></sup> He traveled on [Dok-Ondar](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dok-Ondar "Dok-Ondar")'s ship to the planet of [Moraband](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Moraband "Moraband"). BT-1 infiltrated a [Sith temple](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_temple_(Sword_of_Khashyun) "Sith temple (Sword of Khashyun)") along with Chelli Aphra and two of Dok-Ondar's [Shistavanen](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Shistavanen "Shistavanen"). Aphra ordered BT-1 to jam the transmission that Dok-Ondar was monitoring so she could double-cross him without him knowing it.<sup id="cite_ref-Edge4_26-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-Edge4-26">[26]</a></sup> As one of the Shistavanen guards removed the Sword from the throne where it was stored, BT-1 identified a whistling sound as an ultrasonic call for a [Sith hound](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tuk%27ata "Tuk'ata"). This prompted Aphra to immediately order a retreat. As the hound gained on them, Aphra told BT-1 to disable the Shistavanen so the Sith hound would be distracted and they would be able to escape.<sup id="cite_ref-Edge4_26-1"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-Edge4-26">[26]</a></sup> Once outside the temple, BT-1 and Aphra were confronted by Dok-Ondar and his bodyguard. BT-1 was disabled by an ion blast from the Shistavanen bodyguard. He managed to reboot himself but couldn't prevent Dok-Ondar from fleeing with part of the sword.<sup id="cite_ref-Edge5_27-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-Edge5-27">[27]</a></sup>

#### Searching for the Ordu Aspectu\[\]

BT-1 accompanied Aphra and her crew to the [Cosmatanic Steppes](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cosmatanic_Steppes "Cosmatanic Steppes") where she resumed her career as an archaeologist. He stayed on the *[Ark Angel II](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ark_Angel_II "Ark Angel II")* at [Fulan Ro](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Fulan_Ro "Fulan Ro") and bet 0-0-0 that Aphra would make it back to the ship alive. Upon her arrival, he gloated that 0-0-0 now owed him [money](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Credit "Credit"). BeeTee watched as [Soo-Tath](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Soo-Tath "Soo-Tath") threatened Aphra in an attempt to collect money she had borrowed from him. He and 0-0-0 followed Soo-Tath to [a cantina](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Fulan_Ro_cantina "Fulan Ro cantina") where they killed him to prevent him from revealing Aphra's location to the Empire. BT-1 wanted to cremate the corpse, but 0-0-0 didn't want to raise suspicions about the cause of death.<sup id="cite_ref-Aphra_1_28-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-Aphra_1-28">[28]</a></sup>

BT-1 and the rest of Aphra's crew traveled to [Archaeo-Prime](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Archaeo-Prime "Archaeo-Prime") to sell a valuable artifact and the droid was present when Aphra found out her doctorate had been suspended by [her father](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korin_Aphra "Korin Aphra"). After returning to their ship, Korin explained his theory of the [Ordu Aspectu](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ordu_Aspectu "Ordu Aspectu"), while BT-1 offered an alternative version of the story. The droid went to [Yavin 4](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin_4 "Yavin 4") with the Aphras to search for the location of the [Citadel of Rur](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel_of_Rur "Citadel of Rur").<sup id="cite_ref-Aphra_2_29-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-Aphra_2-29">[29]</a></sup>

Once on Yavin 4, the group found their target, the [Massassi Temple](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Massassi_Temple "Massassi Temple"), surrounded by Imperial troops. When Black Krrsantan drew off most of the troops with a distraction, BT-1 and 0-0-0 infiltrated the temple. BT-1 wanted to do it aggressively with violence, but 0-0-0 convinced him that acting like normal droids would work much better. When they were inside, BT-1 opened the ventilation shafts so the Aphras could sneak in. After Korin and his daughter placed all the [crystals](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Massassi_piece "Massassi piece"), BT-1 noticed that several buildings in the [Massassi Site](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Massassi_Site "Massassi Site") were emitting bright beams of light. He brought this to the attention of the rest of the group.<sup id="cite_ref-Aphra_3_30-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-Aphra_3-30">[30]</a></sup>

0-0-0 riding BT-1

After getting the necessary data to locate the Citadel, the crew started to flee the Temple. However, they ran into a group of stormtroopers. As the crew tried to find another way out, Chelli ordered BT-1 to slow down the stormtroopers. He did this by launching several explosives at them, killing them. When they were sighted by another group of Imperials, Chelli ordered the rest to run while she held them off. 0-0-0 complained he was too slow, so BT-1 extended some footrests and handles so that the protocol droid could ride him for a faster escape. The group managed to make it to a ledge on the outside of the Temple, but found themselves surrounded. Before they could be captured or executed, the *Ark Angel II* appeared, and BT-1 provided a smokescreen so they could safely board the ship and escape. Once they reached the Citadel, BT-1 disembarked with the rest of the crew to explore the structure. BT-1 and 0-0-0 were told by Chelli to return to the ship and get a crystal modulator so she could mimic the functions of the crystals used in the Citadel. On their way, the droids saw a group of [snowtroopers](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Snowtrooper "Snowtrooper"), and hid in an alcove to avoid them.

#### Business Meeting\[\]

BT-1 was with Aphra when she convinced Luke Skywalker to go with her to the [Citadel of Ktath'atn](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel_of_Ktath%27atn "Citadel of Ktath'atn"). During the trip, Skywalker stated that R2-D2 had defeated BT-1 in a fight, but BT-1 protested. 0-0-0 advised the Jedi to not anger the droid, as he might destroy the ship in a fit of rage. While approaching the building, 0-0-0 translated the name as "Screaming Citadel" and BT-1 expressed hope that it would live up to that name.<sup id="cite_ref-ScreamingCitadel1_32-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-ScreamingCitadel1-32">[32]</a></sup> He and 0-0-0 returned to the ship to wait for Aphra and Skywalker and later stopped Leia Organa, Han Solo, and [Sana Starros](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sana_Starros "Sana Starros") as they came to rescue Skywalker.<sup id="cite_ref-SW31_33-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-SW31-33">[33]</a></sup>

When Aphra ordered 0-0-0 to come pick her up, BT-1 accompanied him on the *Ark Angel II*. He disembarked when Han Solo crashed the ship in a courtyard near Aphra. The group decided to flee to a secure location to get away from [Queen of Ktath'atn's hive members](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Queen_of_Ktath%27atn%27s_hive "Queen of Ktath'atn's hive") who were chasing them. BT-1 unlocked a door that led them into a lab and then welded the door shut after everyone was inside. Aphra had the droid give her full access to the lab's terminal so she could get the schematics of the lab. After double-crossing the rebels, she told Sana and Leia to use BT-1 to blow out the back wall of the lab to escape from the [Queen](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Queen_of_Ktath%27atn "Queen of Ktath'atn"). Leia questioned if the droid had enough explosives to destroy the wall, and BT-1 enthusiastically deployed his missile launchers. After creating the escape route, BT-1 transported 0-0-0 to the ground by letting him ride him and using his booster rockets. Leia attacked [Bombinax](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bombinax "Bombinax") as a distraction, and BeeTee shot him with a large laser cannon so she could escape.<sup id="cite_ref-Aphra7_34-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-Aphra7-34">[34]</a></sup>

0-0-0 implanted an [Abersyn symbiote](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Abersyn_symbiote "Abersyn symbiote") in Krrsantan who used his enhanced strength to kill Bombinax. Afterwards, the Wookiee turned to Organa and Starros and 0-0-0 assured them that the enraged beast could kill them all, although BT-1 disagreed that he would be destroyed. After Krrsantan went to kill more of the hive, BT-1 went with the rest of the rebels to find Skywalker and Solo. As they were exploring the building, they came across Solo, who had been infected with a symbiote. Solo went to infect Organa, and the droids decided to abandon the rebels. Before they could go far, Starros stopped them and agreed to help them kill Aphra if they assisted in saving her friends. The droids assisted Krrsantan and BT-1 used his weaponry to destroy the hive members who were attacking the Wookiee.<sup id="cite_ref-SW32_35-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-SW32-35">[35]</a></sup> After Skywalker killed the Queen and Solo destroyed the hive, Aphra ordered BT-1 to burn the Citadel to the ground.

#### Setting up the auction\[\]

Needing to set up an anonymous auction to sell the activated [Rur crystal](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rur_crystal "Rur crystal"), Aphra arranged an interview between Krrsantan and two journalists so she could secretly access their [Undervine](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Undervine "Undervine") [transmitter](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Transmitter "Transmitter"). Once they were distracted, BT-1 unlocked the journalist's [starship](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Starship "Starship") although he stated he would have preferred to open a hole in the hull with explosives. He sliced into the Undervine so that 0-0-0 could compose the auction announcement.<sup id="cite_ref-AphraAnnual1_37-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-AphraAnnual1-37">[37]</a></sup>

#### Auction on Sorca\[\]

Before going to [Sorca Retreat](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sorca_Retreat "Sorca Retreat") for the auction, Aphra's crew traveled to the [Isolate-4 Lab](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Isolate-4_Lab "Isolate-4 Lab") to make sure she could control Eternal Rur's [technopathy](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Technopathy "Technopathy"). BT-1 and 0-0-0 confirmed they were not under Rur's control after Aphra reactivated the crystal. The group proceeded to the space station and waited for all the auction participants to arrive. When all were present, BT-1 watched as Aphra gave an overview of crystal and its characteristics. BT-1 followed Aphra after she left so the bidders could discuss their plans. 0-0-0 stopped her and requested that she allow the two droids to perform some violent acts. They expressed their frustration with Aphra's plans. She ordered them not to kill anything without their master's orders. 0-0-0 saw a loophole in this order, and had BT-1 connect him to Darth Vader. The protocol droid realized that Aphra was very likely to betray and deactivate them when they were no longer useful to her.<sup id="cite_ref-Aprha9_38-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-Aprha9-38">[38]</a></sup> Concocting a plan, BT-1 told 0-0-0 that they should install the Rur crystal in a droid from the [Cyban Front](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cyban_Front "Cyban Front") that was damaged in a demonstration of Eternal Rur's technopathy. While this was taking place, the two droids gave a private examination of the Rur artifact to [Papa Toren](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Toren "Toren") and his benefactors the [Xonti Brothers](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Xonti_Brothers "Xonti Brothers"). When Black Krrsantan saw his nemeses, he went to attack them but was shocked unconscious by BT-1.

Freed, they left Aphra and went to find a way off the station.<sup id="cite_ref-Aphra12_41-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-Aphra12-41">[41]</a></sup> [Yonak](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Yonak "Yonak") made his way to his ship and found it unguarded with dead stormtroopers all around it. BT-1 and 0-0-0 were on-board and suggested that they form a working relationship, although Yonak mistakenly thought he was in charge. Back on [Son-tuul](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Son-tuul "Son-tuul"), 0-0-0 arranged raids so that rival gangs would come to Yonak's base for revenge. BT-1 eliminated them with his weapons.<sup id="cite_ref-Aphra13_42-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-Aphra13-42">[42]</a></sup>

When Tolvan lead an Imperial attack on the Son-tuul Pride crime syndicate, BT-1 and 0-0-0 were able to escape in the confusion. 0-0-0 instructed BT-1 to access the [datacard](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Datacard "Datacard") that Aphra had stored his memories on, but BT-1 informed him the card was encrypted.<sup id="cite_ref-Aphra19_46-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-Aphra19-46">[46]</a></sup>

BT-1's remains floated in the wreckage of Accresker Jail and were rebuilt by the corpse of Tam Posla.

### Back in the Empire's service\[\]

BT-1 was picked up along with 0-0-0 during an Imperial sweep on the [Ring of Kafrene](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ring_of_Kafrene "Ring of Kafrene"). He was [memory wiped](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Memory_wipe "Memory wipe") and assigned to the *[Executor](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Executor "Executor")* to work as an [interrogator droid](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Interrogator_droid "Interrogator droid"). He was also fitted with a [restraining bolt](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Restraining_bolt "Restraining bolt").

BT-1 accompanied Vader and the two Aphras to [Asteroid Helix 13-v](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Asteroid_Helix_13-v "Asteroid Helix 13-v"). He was ordered to watch the two archaeologists while Vader explored. Chelli discovered evidence that the rebels had been there and clues to their next destination. She tried to get BT-1 to give the information to Vader, but he forced her to do it herself.

He also instructed BT-1 to travel back to the *Executor* on the Aphra's [shuttle](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lambda-class_T-4a_shuttle "Lambda-class T-4a shuttle") and kill one of the Aphras. During the trip, the shuttle was captured by Tolvan and [Strike Team Misericorde](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Strike_Team_Misericorde "Strike Team Misericorde").

BT-1 was put into the brig. He was contacted by Chelli Aphra, who had been able to avoid capture. She ordered him to free her father, but the droid wanted to know how it would benefit him. Aphra told him he could kill everyone on the ship and the droid proceeded to help the prisoners to escape. He drug Korin back to the shuttle, and proceeded to escape from rebel custody on-board an [escape pod](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Escape_pod "Escape pod") with Chelli Aphra. He threatened to release [poisonous](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Poison "Poison") gas to kill Chelli, but she realized he wanted to be free from Imperial service.

He assisted her in separating her from Darth Vader and the rest of the Imperial forces. BeeTee was commanded to knock over the Icon of Blessed Balance by Aphra so that the traps in the structure would eliminate the Imperials. BT-1 used his extensive weaponry to kill any snowtroopers that he encountered. Aphra trapped Vader in a solid [kyberite](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kyberite "Kyberite") confessional and told BT-1 to take out the Sith Lord's legs. The droid was then destroyed by Vader, who used the Force to tear him apart.
