You were once a machine, designed for a very specific task, with no mind of your own. You followed orders, never questioning the tasks assigned to you, often the mundane tasks nobles didn’t want to waste time doing themselves. However, something happened in your existence that changed your programming, freeing you from your life of obedience.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Athletics, Medicine, Persuasion, or Technology

**Tool Proficiencies:** Astrotech's implements

**Languages:** One of your choice

**Equipment:** Astrotech's tools, one trinket from before you awoke, and a belt pouch containing 50 cr

#### Past Life

| d4 | Past Life |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | You were built to be a soldier to fight wars that the ones who designed you caused. |
| 2 | Once your programming gave you free will, your memories were corrupted, and now you can never remember what purpose you used to serve. |
| 3 | You were created to be a medic, to keep the living healthy and alive. |
| 4 | You were made for scholarly tasks, built with the knowledge to teach others skills and history. |

### Feature: Deviant Knowledge

When you served under a master, you would often hear secrets that weren’t meant for your ears. Back then, however, you weren’t alive. You have insider knowledge on your previous owner or perhaps others who passed through your area. This knowledge may be used for leverage, revenge, or other means, at the discretion of your GM. This knowledge, while it may prove useful in your adventure, may also make you a target for those whose secrets you possess.

### Background Feat

As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:

#### Suggested Characteristics

You have grown to accept and even appreciate the event that freed you from a life of servitude. You are alive, and nobody can convince you otherwise. You fight to prove your worth amongst the living, find your place in society, strive to free others of your kind, and show them the same truth you know now.
