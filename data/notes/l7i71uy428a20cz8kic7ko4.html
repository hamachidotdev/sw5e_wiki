<p>In lieu of the equipment granted by your class and background, you can elect to purchase your starting gear. If you do so, you receive no equipment from your class and background, and instead roll for your starting wealth using the criteria below:</p>
<h3 id="techcasting"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#techcasting"></a>Techcasting</h3>
<p><em><strong>Engineer:</strong> 1st level</em><br>
During your training you have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wristpad. See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.</p>
<h4 id="tech-powers-known"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#tech-powers-known"></a>Tech Powers Known</h4>
<p>You learn 6 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the engineer table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.</p>
<h4 id="tech-points"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#tech-points"></a>Tech Points</h4>
<p>You have a number of tech points equal to your engineer level x 2, as shown in the Tech Points column of the engineer table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<h4 id="max-power-level"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#max-power-level"></a>Max Power Level</h4>
<p>Many tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the engineer table.</p>
<p>You may only cast tech powers at 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.</p>
<h4 id="techcasting-ability"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#techcasting-ability"></a>Techcasting Ability</h4>
<p>Intelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. Additionally, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Tech save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Tech attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>

<p>You use a wristpad (found in chapter 5) or the tools in which you are granted proficiency by this class as a tech focus for your tech powers.</p>
<h3 id="potent-aptitude"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#potent-aptitude"></a>Potent Aptitude</h3>
<p><em><strong>Engineer:</strong> 1st level</em><br>
Your technological experience lends you an uncommon insight that you can use to bolster your allies. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Potent Aptitude die, a d4. This die changes as you gain engineer levels, as shown in the Potent Aptitude column of the engineer table.</p>
<p>Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Potent Aptitude die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Potent Aptitude die is rolled, it is lost.</p>
<p>A creature can have only one Potent Aptitude die at a time.</p>
<p>You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<h3 id="infuse-item"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#infuse-item"></a>Infuse Item</h3>
<p><em><strong>Engineer:</strong> 2nd level</em><br>
You gain the ability to temporarily enhance a weapon or armor. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one unenhanced object that is a suit of armor, a shield, or a simple or martial weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes an enhanced item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it’s armor or a shield or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it’s a weapon.</p>
<p>Once you’ve used this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 13th level, Artificially Intelligent</em>
Your artificial intelligence has learned to control the suit without you being in it. It is now a valid target of the <em>tracker droid interface</em> tech power.</p>
<p>While your armor is acting independently, it uses your ability scores, saving throws, and skills, and it has hit points equal to your engineer level. If reduced to 0 hit points, it falls directly to the ground, and it can not be equipped again until you finish a long rest.</p>

<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Shield Generator</em>
You modify your shield generator to project outward. As a bonus action you can amplify your shield until the start of your next turn. Each creature within 5 feet of you gains a bonus to AC equal to your shield’s bonus.</p>
<p>You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

Instead, while anchored, a light shield provides one-quarter cover, a medium shield provides half cover, and a heavy shield provides three-quarters cover.</p>
