## [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#chapter-6-customization-options)Chapter 6: Customization Options

The combination of your character’s personal features, as well as their chosen deployment, defines your character’s capabilities in the space component of the game, and the personal details you create set your character apart from every other character. Even within your class, species, and deployment specialization you have options to fine-tune what your character can do. But this chapter is for players who want to go a step further.

This chapter defines two sets of rules for customizing your character: multispeccing and ventures. Multispeccing lets you combine deployments together, and ventures are special options you can choose as you gain ranks.

Ships are locked to their respective size-driven tiers and have no multiclass parallels.

## [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#multispecializing)Multispecializing

Multispecializing allows you to gain ranks in multiple deployment specializations. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those deployments to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard specialization options.

With this rule, you have the option of gaining a rank in a new specialization whenever you advance in rank, instead of gaining a rank in your current specialization. Your ranks in all your deployments are added together to determine your character rank. For example, if you have two ranks in pilot and one in gunner, you’re a 3rd-rank character.

As you advance in ranks, you might primarily remain a member of your original deployment with just a single rank in another specialization, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the deployment you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth specialization. Compared to a single-specialized character of the same rank, you’ll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.

> #### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#multispecializing-example)Multispecializing Example
>
> Drew is playing a 1st-rank pilot. When his character is ready to progress to 2nd rank, Drew decides that his character will multispec instead of continuing to progress as a pilot. Drew’s character has been spending a lot of time with Rickey’s gunner, and has even been doing some simulations. Drew decides that his character will multispec into the gunner deployment, and thus his character becomes a 1st-rank pilot and 1st-rank gunner (written as pilot 1/gunner 1).
> When Drew’s character is ready to progress to 3rd rank, he can decide whether to add another pilot rank (becoming a pilot 2/gunner 1), another gunner rank (becoming a pilot 1/gunner 2), or a rank in a third deployment, perhaps dabbling in the inner workings of the ship (becoming a pilot 1/gunner 1/mechanic 1).

### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#prerequisites)Prerequisites

Unlike classes, there are no requirements for multispeccing. When a player has progressed to a rank higher than 1, they can choose to multispec or focus on their primary deployment specialization, with no external requirements or considerations.

### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#milestones)Milestones

Rather than traditional experience and book-keeping, ranks should be awarded as milestones for completing a specific encounter, or obtaining certain knowledge.

### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#proficiency-bonus)Proficiency Bonus

Ships do not have a proficiency bonus. When a feature references a proficiency bonus, instead use the proficiency bonus of the appropriate crewmember as long as the crewmember has at least one deployment rank.

> Rather than having a separate proficiency bonus for the space and ground portions of your game, your proficiency bonus for space is the same as that of the ground.

If a deployment feature or venture allows you to forgo your proficiency bonus, you may only do so once.

#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#expertise)Expertise

If you have expertise in a skill as well as a feature that lets you forgo your proficiency bonus, you can only forgo your proficiency bonus once. For instance, if you are a 5th-level, 4th-rank pilot with an 18 in Intelligence and expertise in Piloting, you add 10 to your Piloting checks (4 + 2 x 3). If you use the 4th-rank pilot feature “That’s a Good Trick” to forgo your proficiency bonus, you instead add 7 for the Piloting check as a part of that Evade action (4 + 2 x 3 - 3).

## [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#gunning-styles)Gunning Styles

Certain deployment features or ventures offer your choice of Gunning Style. Choose from the following. You can’t take a Gunning Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#cannoneer)Cannoneer

You are skilled with laser cannons. While you are firing a primary weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls and save DCs.

#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#heavy-gunner)Heavy Gunner

You are skilled with railguns and turbolasers. While you are firing a secondary weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and save DCs.

#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#payload-delivery)Payload Delivery

You are skilled with mines, missiles, rockets, and other explosive weapons. When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for a tertiary or quaternary weapon, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.

## [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#gunning-masteries)Gunning Masteries

Certain deployment features or ventures offer your choice of Gunning Mastery. Choose from the following. You can’t take a Gunning Mastery option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#cannon-mastery)Cannon Mastery

You are the master of laser cannons. While you are firing a primary weapon, when you take the Fire action, you can choose to fire rapidly at the expense of accuracy. Your attacks are made without the aid of your proficiency bonus, but you use your bonus action to make an additional attack, also without your proficiency bonus.

#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#heavy-gun-mastery)Heavy Gun Mastery

You are the master of railguns and turbolasers. While you are firing a secondary weapon, before you make an attack, you can choose to double your proficiency bonus. If the attack hits, you reduce the damage dealt by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus.

#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#payload-mastery)Payload Mastery

You are the master of missiles, rockets, and other ship-board explosive weapons. While you are firing a tertiary or quaternary weapon, you can choose to reduce the DC by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus. If you do, and the target fails the saving throw, they take additional damage equal to twice your proficiency bonus.

## Ventures

Ventures represent talents beyond the deployment specialization of a character. This embodies their training and experience in other aspects of their lives. At certain deployment ranks, your deployment gives you the Venture feature. You can take each venture only once, unless the venture’s description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a venture to take that venture. If you ever lose a venture’s prerequisite, you can’t use that venture again until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Spacecasting venture requires you to be able to cast force or tech powers. If your character loses the ability to do so, you can’t benefit from the Spacecasting venture until you regain the ability to cast force or tech powers.

> Ventures, and this book in general, are designed and written in such a way that they have minimal impact on the ground game. All ventures are intended to only be usable while deployed aboard a ship, even if they don’t explicitly say it.

You cause the target to become shocked until the end of your ship’s next turn. When this attack hits a target, if there is a ship within 300 feet who is shocked, an arc of lightning courses between the two ships, dealing 1d6 lightning damage to both of them. If there are multiple other ships who are shocked, the lightning leaps to the closest ship.

You damage the ship’s weapon systems. The first time it would deal damage before the start of your next turn, that damage is reduced by 1d6.

> If a ship being fought does not have the system that is targeted in the Targeting Fire venture (e.g., an X-Wing hit by an attack utilizing Targeting Fire: Gravity Generator does not have a gravity generator), then consider allowing the venture’s effects to work via alternative means (e.g., the hyperdrive is hit instead).
