<p>Plotting a hyperspace course requires incredibly difficult calculations. Before jumping to hyperspace, a ship must plot a course via astrogation by completing 10 astrogation equations. When not under stress, a crewmember can take 10 minutes to carefully make these calculations and check them, resulting in automatic success. When under duress, such as in combat situations, a crewmember can calculate astronavigation with an Intelligence (Astrogation) check as an action on their turn, and then consults the <strong>Astrogation Results</strong> table.</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>d20</th><th>Result</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>9 or lower</td><td>Your calculations fail, resulting in no completed equations.</td></tr><tr><td>10-15</td><td>Your calculations are adequate, resulting in one completed equation.</td></tr><tr><td>16-20</td><td>Your calculations include a breakthrough, resulting in two completed equations.</td></tr><tr><td>21-25</td><td>Your calculations are excellent, resulting in three completed equations.</td></tr><tr><td>26-29</td><td>Your calculations are masterful, resulting in four completed equations.</td></tr><tr><td>30+</td><td>Your calculations are perfect, resulting in five completed equations.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Additionally, the accuracy of the check is affected by how old the astrogation information is. If the astrogation information is less than a day old, the operator has advantage on the check. If the information is older than a week, however, they have disadvantage on the check.</p>
<p>You may choose to penalize your Intelligence (Astrogation) checks by 5 before making them in order to reduce your travel time by 24 hours; if this would reduce the travel time to less than 24 hours, you instead reduce the remaining travel time by one-half, to a minimum of 1 hour. You must restart your calculations if you change this course choice.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may gain a +5 circumstance bonus on your Intelligence (Astrogation) checks if you voluntarily double the travel time.</p>

<p>A jump to hyperspace can always be rushed, being made before all ten equations are completed, but such travel can be incredibly dangerous. If a starship is disabled because of a poorly plotted hyperspace course, the GM usually chooses the point at which the ship drops out of hyperspace at random. GMs looking for a more in-depth description of a hyperspace mishap can consult the table below. For every complete equation, add 1 to your roll on the table below. If you roll a 1 on your die, you roll again on the table in addition to suffering the indicated penalty. If you make a jump without <em>any</em> calculations and roll a 20, your ship comes out of hyperspace unscathed, but in a completely unknown location.</p>

<p>When a starship enters or exits hyperspace, it generates a short burst of Cronau radiation. Any facility with adequate sensor arrays can detect this radiation burst with a DC 20 Wisdom (Scan) check. Success would indicate that a ship entered or exited the system as well as the point of arrival or departure. With a successful Intelligence (Probe) check (DC 25), the angle of departure can be determined, indicating possible destinations.</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>D20</th><th>Result</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>20+</td><td>The ship suffers no adverse consequences.</td></tr><tr><td>18-19</td><td>The ship encounters dumped cargo, setting off a collision alarm. The ship must make a DC 15 Constitution save. On a failure, the ship takes 3 hull dice of damage; the ship takes half damage on a suc-cess.

Scan and Probe checks aboard the ship are made with disadvantage until the ship is refitted.</td></tr><tr><td>12-14</td><td>The ship passes too close to a supernova, overloading computer systems with solar radiation. Intelligence checks aboard the ship have disadvantage until the ship is refitted.</td></tr><tr><td>9-11</td><td>The ship passes through an unexpected gravity field, causing structural stress. Maneuver checks are made with disadvantage until the ship is refitted.</td></tr><tr><td>6-8</td><td>Intense gravity warps the vessel’s structural integrity. The ship’s AC is reduced by 2 until the ship is refitted.</td></tr><tr><td>3-5</td><td>The ship collides with significant debris, its hull immediately taking kinetic damage equal to one-tenth of its max HP, and shields regenerate at half their normal rate until the ship is refitted.</td></tr><tr><td>1-2</td><td>The hyperdrive suffers a catastrophic failure, and is rendered unusable until the ship is refitted.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p><strong>The BoSS:</strong> In addition to their duties of regulating information regarding ship ownership, the BoSS also maintains a database of astrogation information. Each time a ship docks in a major spaceport, they can update their astrogation data for a 150 credit fee. Astrogation data is routinely updated and is rarely more than a week old.</p>
