"*Korriban shall be as it always was. A graveyard for the darkest of the Sith Lords, still whispering within their tombs. It shall always be a source of evil, spawning threats throughout the millennia.*"

―[Darth Traya](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kreia "Kreia")<sup id="cite_ref-tsl_11-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-tsl-11">[11]</a></sup>

**Korriban**, known as **Pesegam** during the reign of [Xim](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Xim/Legends "Xim/Legends"), and also known as **Moraband** by the time of the [Clone Wars](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars/Legends "Clone Wars/Legends"), was the sole [planet](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Planet/Legends "Planet/Legends") in the [Horuset system](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Horuset_system "Horuset system"), located across the galaxy from [Koros Major](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Empress_Teta/Legends "Empress Teta/Legends"). It was the original homeworld of the [Sith species](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_(species)/Legends "Sith (species)/Legends") and a sacred planet for the [Sith Order](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Order_of_the_Sith_Lords "Order of the Sith Lords"), housing the tombs for many ancient and powerful [Dark Lords of the Sith](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Lord_of_the_Sith/Legends "Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends"), and containing immense [dark side](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_side_of_the_Force/Legends "Dark side of the Force/Legends") power.

After the [Hundred-Year Darkness](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hundred-Year_Darkness/Legends "Hundred-Year Darkness/Legends"), the remaining [Dark Jedi](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Jedi/Legends "Dark Jedi/Legends") interbred with the Sith species and ruled the Sith using their Force powers. After the [Great Hyperspace War](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Hyperspace_War/Legends "Great Hyperspace War/Legends"), Korriban was abandoned and became a barren world. It was the site of a Sith Academy, and became the headquarters of the [One Sith](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/One_Sith "One Sith").

It was close to [Bosthirda](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bosthirda/Legends "Bosthirda/Legends") and was located on the [Nache Bhelfia](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Nache_Bhelfia "Nache Bhelfia") and [Kamat Krote](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kamat_Krote "Kamat Krote") hyperspace lanes.

Korriban as seen from space.

This remote, foreboding planet was the original homeworld of the Sith species.<sup id="cite_ref-pena_12-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-pena-12">[12]</a></sup> At some point prior to [30,000 BBY](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/30,000_BBY "30,000 BBY"), a [Killik](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Killik/Legends "Killik/Legends") colony was established on Korriban, which eventually produced a [Killik Sith warrior](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Unidentified_Killik_Sith_warrior "Unidentified Killik Sith warrior"). The insectoid colonists were swiftly [driven off](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Korriban_(Killik_Invasion) "Battle of Korriban (Killik Invasion)") by the Sith.

The [Rakata](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rakata/Legends "Rakata/Legends") [invaded](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Invasion_of_Korriban "Invasion of Korriban") Korriban in an attempt to integrate the world into the [Infinite Empire](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Infinite_Empire "Infinite Empire") around [27,700 BBY](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/27,700_BBY "27,700 BBY"), intending to harvest slaves from the planet to be used for Rakatan projects.<sup id="cite_ref-kotor_13-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-kotor-13">[13]</a></sup> The sole artifact to survive this era was the ancient [Star Map](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Map "Star Map"), around which the [tomb](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tomb_of_Naga_Sadow "Tomb of Naga Sadow") of [Naga Sadow](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Naga_Sadow/Legends "Naga Sadow/Legends") was later built.

The Rakata were eventually forced off the world after the Sith King [Adas](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Adas "Adas") led his people against them.<sup id="cite_ref-pena_12-1"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-pena-12">[12]</a></sup> Adas died in the battle, and thus, despite this victory, the Sith society crumbled, and, in the ensuing centuries of strife, the Sith relocated to worlds such as [Arbra](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Arbra/Legends "Arbra/Legends"), [Ziost](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ziost/Legends "Ziost/Legends"), and [Tund](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tund/Legends "Tund/Legends"), using captured Rakatan vessels, leaving Korriban as a graveyard world populated only by religious fanatics.<sup id="cite_ref-TEA_2-8"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-TEA-2">[2]</a></sup>

The world was at least a nominal member of [Xim's empire](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Xim%27s_empire "Xim's empire") from around [25,126 BBY](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/25,126_BBY "25,126 BBY") until its fall, and was given the name Pesegam.<sup id="cite_ref-TEA_2-9"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-TEA-2">[2]</a></sup>

### Sith Empire\[\]

"*Korriban, the birthplace of my power. I arrived as a Sith Acolyte, trained in the dark side; now, an apprentice to a Sith Lord. My rage has purpose. I will hunt the Jedi and destroy the Galactic Republic.*"

―Unnamed [Sith Warrior](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Warrior "Sith Warrior")<sup><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.swtor.com/media/trailers/sith-warrior-game-trailer">[src]</a></sup>

The [Sith Empire](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Empire/Legends "Sith Empire/Legends") was founded in [6900 BBY](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/6900_BBY "6900 BBY") by [exiled](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Exiles "Exiles") fallen [Jedi](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi/Legends "Jedi/Legends") fleeing the [Battle of Corbos](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Corbos "Battle of Corbos"), which concluded the [Hundred-Year Darkness](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hundred-Year_Darkness/Legends "Hundred-Year Darkness/Legends").<sup id="cite_ref-nec_14-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-nec-14">[14]</a></sup> The fallen Jedi [landed](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Discovery_of_Korriban "Discovery of Korriban") on Korriban.<sup id="cite_ref-db_15-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-db-15">[15]</a></sup>

Using their training in the Force, the fallen Jedi amazed the Sith and elevated themselves to god-like status on Korriban, becoming the rulers of the Sith people.<sup id="cite_ref-nec_14-1"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-nec-14">[14]</a></sup> As years passed, and interbreeding occurred between the Fallen Jedi and the Sith,<sup id="cite_ref-kotor_13-1"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-kotor-13">[13]</a></sup> the term "Sith" came to mean not only the original inhabitants of Korriban, but also their fallen Jedi masters. Until the rise of Naga Sadow, the existence of the Sith Empire was unknown to the [Galactic Republic](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Republic/Legends "Galactic Republic/Legends").

Under the pall of Sith magic, this desolate world became more hellish and dangerous<sup id="cite_ref-TEGtPaM_5-3"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-TEGtPaM-5">[5]</a></sup>. The Sith Lords erected huge palaces and burial complexes to honor their fallen Dark Lords. Circa [5000 BBY](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/5000_BBY/Legends "5000 BBY/Legends"), the planet became an endpoint of the newly-formed [Daragon Trail](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Daragon_Trail "Daragon Trail") hyperspace lane, when it was discovered by [Gav](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Gav_Daragon "Gav Daragon") and [Jori Daragon](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jori_Daragon "Jori Daragon")<sup id="cite_ref-totj2_16-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-totj2-16">[16]</a></sup>. This event triggered the [Great Hyperspace War](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Hyperspace_War/Legends "Great Hyperspace War/Legends"). After the fall of the Sith Empire, the planet lost much of its prominence in [the galaxy](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_galaxy/Legends "The galaxy/Legends"), eventually falling off the galactic starcharts for a thousand years. Despite the belief the Sith as a species became extinct after the end of the war, isolated enclaves of [Kissai](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kissai "Kissai") and [Massassi](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Massassi/Legends "Massassi/Legends") existed on the planet over a millennia after their empire's fall.<sup id="cite_ref-KOTORCG_7-5"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-KOTORCG-7">[7]</a></sup>

### Old Sith Wars\[\]

Korriban was resettled prior to [3993 BBY](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/3993_BBY "3993 BBY") by [Dark Jedi](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Jedi/Legends "Dark Jedi/Legends") survivors of the [Exar Kun War](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Sith_War/Legends "Great Sith War/Legends"),<sup>[<a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Wookieepedia:Sourcing" title="Wookieepedia:Sourcing"><i>source?</i></a>]</sup> and was home to the new settlement of [Dreshdae](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dreshdae "Dreshdae") and a [Sith training academy](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_academy "Sith academy").<sup id="cite_ref-kotor_13-3"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-kotor-13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-sal_17-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-sal-17">[17]</a></sup> In 3993 BBY, as part of the [Great Hunt](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Hunt_(Jedi) "Great Hunt (Jedi)"), [Duron Qel-Droma](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Duron_Qel-Droma "Duron Qel-Droma") and [Shaela Nuur](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Shaela_Nuur "Shaela Nuur") died on the planet, failing to [cleanse](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cleansing_of_Korriban "Cleansing of Korriban") it of [terentateks](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Terentatek/Legends "Terentatek/Legends").<sup id="cite_ref-kotor_13-4"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-kotor-13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-sal_17-1"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-sal-17">[17]</a></sup> The planet became the sector headquarters of the [Czerka Corporation](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Czerka_Arms/Legends "Czerka Arms/Legends").

After losing his memory, Revan visited and infiltrated the academy again in [3956 BBY](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/3956_BBY "3956 BBY") on his quest to re-discover the Star Forge for the good of the Republic. Seeking the [Star Map](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Map "Star Map") in [Naga Sadow's](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Naga_Sadow/Legends "Naga Sadow/Legends") [tomb](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Burial/Legends "Burial/Legends") he passed the tests and then confronted Uthar. With the death of Master [Uthar Wynn](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Uthar_Wynn "Uthar Wynn"), the academy's headmaster, and Darth Malak himself at the hands of Revan in [3956 BBY](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/3956_BBY "3956 BBY"), the Sith Order collapsed into a [civil war](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Civil_War "Sith Civil War") (which took place [3956](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/3956_BBY "3956 BBY")\-[3950 BBY](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/3950_BBY "3950 BBY")) which decimated the Sith Order.<sup id="cite_ref-tsl_11-2"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-tsl-11">[11]</a></sup>

It took the Republic a couple of years to send an expeditionary force to Korriban (around [3954 BBY](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/3954_BBY "3954 BBY")) in order to deal with any potential Sith who might attempt to take up the mantle of Dark Lord. They found a planet nearly in ruins—barren and lifeless as a result of the then unknown civil war.<sup id="cite_ref-tsl_11-3"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-tsl-11">[11]</a></sup> It was assumed by the commanders of the Republic task force that the remnants of the Sith turned on each other, vying for what little power remained. It was also said that Revan had always intended to return to Korriban one day to subdue any would-be Sith insurgents, but he then disappeared.<sup id="cite_ref-tsl_11-4"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-tsl-11">[11]</a></sup> However, the Republic discovered evidence that several Sith Lords did manage to escape the planetary conflagration, fleeing to remote corners of the galaxy.<sup id="cite_ref-nec_14-2"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-nec-14">[14]</a></sup>

After the fall of Darth Malak, the ancient tombs within the [Valley of the Dark Lords](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Valley_of_the_Dark_Lords/Legends "Valley of the Dark Lords/Legends") were plundered by grave-robbers. Each tomb was once infused with the history and heritage of the old Sith Empire, containing great mysteries and powerful relics of the Force.<sup id="cite_ref-pod_18-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-pod-18">[18]</a></sup> Many broken, charred corpses littered the plains of Korriban during this time, virtually all that remained of the Sith who once inhabited the world. However, their malignant spirits remained, ready to confront any who disturb their rest by way of their guardian-familiars, the [Hssiss](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hssiss "Hssiss").<sup id="cite_ref-tsl_11-5"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-tsl-11">[11]</a></sup>

In the chaos following the [Jedi Civil War](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Civil_War "Jedi Civil War"), which nearly destroyed the [Jedi Order](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Order/Legends "Jedi Order/Legends"), [Jedi Master](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Master/Legends "Jedi Master/Legends") [Lonna Vash](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lonna_Vash "Lonna Vash") used Korriban as a hideout.

After [escaping](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Duel_in_the_Korriban_Academy_(First_Jedi_Purge) "Duel in the Korriban Academy (First Jedi Purge)") the trap, the Exile discovered the long lost [tomb](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tomb_of_Ludo_Kressh "Tomb of Ludo Kressh") of [Ludo Kressh](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ludo_Kressh "Ludo Kressh").<sup id="cite_ref-tsl_11-6"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-tsl-11">[11]</a></sup>

### Great Galactic War\[\]

The Sith reclaim Korriban.

In the aftermath of the Jedi Civil War, a fleet of Republic ships remained to guard the abandoned Sith world of Korriban. This remained until the onset of the [Great Galactic War](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Galactic_War "Great Galactic War"), when the reformed Sith Empire emerged and began conquering worlds in the [Aparo sector](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Aparo_sector/Legends "Aparo sector/Legends") as well as ambushed the Republic fleet in the [Tingel Arm](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tingel_Arm/Legends "Tingel Arm/Legends"), as part of the Emperor's plan. In the millennium since the Great Hyperspace War, the Empire had lost the location of Korriban, but they regained it when the [Sith Emperor](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tenebrae "Tenebrae") dominated the minds of Revan and Malak.

In order to bolster their forces, the Republic pulled many of their ships to support the fleet which left only a small number of Jedi security ships to patrol Korriban. This action, however, had already been predicted and played right into the Emperor's hand. As the conflict continued, the Sith, knowing that the Republic Forces on Korriban were weakened significantly, staged an assault against the guarding ships and destroyed them thus returning the planet to Sith control, just as the Emperor planned, before the Jedi Council became aware of the incident.

Retaking Korriban had been a top priority for the Sith Empire, when it re-emerged during the Great Galactic War. After retaking the planet, they re-established the Sith Academy.<sup id="cite_ref-Korriban_20-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-Korriban-20">[20]</a></sup>

### Cold War\[\]

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/9/94/Korriban_TOR_New.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20200408130714)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/9/94/Korriban_TOR_New.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200408130714)

Korriban during the [Cold War](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cold_War_(Galactic_Republic%E2%80%93Sith_Empire) "Cold War (Galactic Republic–Sith Empire)").

In the years after the Treaty of Coruscant, Korriban had become a major center of learning for the Sith Empire, the Sith Empire had seemingly built upon the tombs and the former Dreshdae, as well as uncovering many lost tombs and caverns.<sup id="cite_ref-TOR_21-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-TOR-21">[21]</a></sup>

At some point all Acolytes went through training here, seeking to become an apprentice to a Sith Lord or Darth, the typically brutal trials increased, often becoming trials where only one out of numerous Acolytes could possibly survive, the death count was astronomical.<sup id="cite_ref-TOR_21-1"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-TOR-21">[21]</a></sup>

The long practice of murder and betrayal among Sith had become illegal among Acolytes, even punishable by death, this did not mean such things did not take place though, as Acolytes would typically lay traps and ambushes in the tombs or caverns to remove challengers and potential threats, often placing blame on the beasts and crazed denizens of those same tombs.<sup id="cite_ref-TOR_21-2"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-TOR-21">[21]</a></sup>

Eventually the Sith Empire had become desperate in their search to replace those lost on the battlefield, allowing Force-sensitive slaves, captured Jedi and even aliens the opportunity to become acolytes and possibly join the Sith, becoming an apprentice.<sup id="cite_ref-TOR_21-3"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-TOR-21">[21]</a></sup>

At some point, two powerful beings, the [Unidentified Sith Warrior](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Empire%27s_Wrath "Empire's Wrath") and the ancient [Sith Lord](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Lord/Legends "Sith Lord/Legends") [Kallig's](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Aloysius_Kallig "Aloysius Kallig") [descendant](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Nox "Darth Nox") came to Korriban, though possibly not at the same time, and definitely not under the same circumstances, they would both pass their trials at exceptional speeds and become fully fledged Sith apprentices. They would then change galactic history, with one gaining a seat on the [Dark Council](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Council "Dark Council") and the other gaining the title of [Emperor's Wrath](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Emperor%27s_Wrath "Emperor's Wrath").

Some of the [Imperial soldiers](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_soldier "Imperial soldier") stationed there were corrupted by the planet's dark energies and went psychotic, attacking their own comrades or everyone else that wasn't equally corrupted.<sup id="cite_ref-TOR_21-4"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-TOR-21">[21]</a></sup>

### Galactic War\[\]

Korriban Incursion

Soon a [new war](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_War "Galactic War") began between the Republic and the Sith Empire. In [3637 BBY](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/3637_BBY "3637 BBY"), the Republic [invaded](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban_Incursion "Korriban Incursion") Korriban and held the Sith Academy for a short time. The attack was planned by [Colonel](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Colonel/Legends "Colonel/Legends") [Rian Darok](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rian_Darok "Rian Darok") and [SIS](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Republic_Strategic_Information_Service "Republic Strategic Information Service") Agent [Theron Shan](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Theron_Shan "Theron Shan"). However Darok was secretly a member of the [Order of Revan](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Order_of_Revan "Order of Revan"), and the attack was merely a means for the Revanites to obtain [Rakatan](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rakata/Legends "Rakata/Legends") technology from the Academy. A [simultaneous attack](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Assault_on_Tython "Assault on Tython") on [Tython](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tython/Legends "Tython/Legends") was perpetrated by Darok's secret ally, the Dark Councilor [Darth Arkous](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Arkous "Darth Arkous").<sup id="cite_ref-TOR_21-5"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-TOR-21">[21]</a></sup>

At some point during the Rise of the Eternal Empire, Korriban's many temples were reduced to rubble from bombardment by the Zakuul Fleet for the Sith's unwillingness to bend the knee. Though it would be later rebuilt, many ancient artifacts were left buried beneath the sands.<sup id="cite_ref-TOR_21-6"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-TOR-21">[21]</a></sup>

### New Sith Wars\[\]

"*Korriban is the ancestral home of the Sith. It is a place of great power; the dark side lives and breathes in the very core of this world.*"

After capturing Korriban from the Republic in a [brutal battle](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Korriban_(New_Sith_Wars) "Battle of Korriban (New Sith Wars)"), the [Brotherhood of Darkness](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Darkness/Legends "Brotherhood of Darkness/Legends") operated a Sith Academy on the planet. Trainees from the Sith Academy were highly regarded for their potential; those who graduated were reputed as the most powerful Sith Lords amongst the Brotherhood. Such apprentices included a young [Darth Bane](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Bane/Legends "Darth Bane/Legends"), who went on to become a Dark Lord of the Sith.<sup id="cite_ref-pod_18-2"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-pod-18">[18]</a></sup>

### Clone Wars and the Galactic Empire\[\]

In 24 BBY, a Sith Cultist by the name of [Granta Omega](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Granta_Omega "Granta Omega") tried to contact the remaining Sith Lord (or lords) in the galaxy. Although he did meet with the unknown Sith, Omega was [killed](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mission_to_Korriban_(23_BBY) "Mission to Korriban (23 BBY)") by [Obi-Wan Kenobi](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi/Legends "Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends"), though not before Omega killed [Darra Thel-Tanis](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darra_Thel-Tanis "Darra Thel-Tanis").<sup id="cite_ref-Jedi_Quest:_The_Final_Showdown_22-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-Jedi_Quest:_The_Final_Showdown-22">[22]</a></sup>

The world remained desolate until it was taken over by the [Commerce Guild](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Commerce_Guild/Legends "Commerce Guild/Legends") just prior to the [Clone Wars](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars/Legends "Clone Wars/Legends"), c. [24 BBY](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/24_BBY/Legends "24 BBY/Legends").

At some point in the Clone Wars, fallen Jedi [Quinlan Vos](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Quinlan_Vos/Legends "Quinlan Vos/Legends") and [Tol Skorr](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tol_Skorr "Tol Skorr") were racing to find [Darth Andeddu](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Andeddu "Darth Andeddu")'s holocron for Count [Dooku](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dooku/Legends "Dooku/Legends").<sup id="cite_ref-Star_Wars_Republic_63:_Striking_from_the_Shadows_24-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-Star_Wars_Republic_63:_Striking_from_the_Shadows-24">[24]</a></sup> Vos won by allowing a [Tuk'ata](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tuk%27ata/Legends "Tuk'ata/Legends") to scare Skorr off. As a reward, Count [Dooku](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dooku/Legends "Dooku/Legends") gave Andeddu's [lightsaber](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber/Legends "Lightsaber/Legends") crystal to Vos.

At some point near the end of the Clone Wars, [Jedi Master](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Master/Legends "Jedi Master/Legends") [Yoda](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Yoda/Legends "Yoda/Legends") was sent on a mission to Korriban, now alternatively known as Moraband, by the spirit of [Qui-Gon Jinn](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Qui-Gon_Jinn/Legends "Qui-Gon Jinn/Legends") to finish the work he had started and discover the purpose of life. While there, the dark side was used by [Sith Lords](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Lord/Legends "Sith Lord/Legends") [Darth Sidious](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Palpatine/Legends "Palpatine/Legends") and [Darth Tyranus](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dooku/Legends "Dooku/Legends") to try to "break" Yoda and make the Grand Master turn to the dark side. They placed in front of him many visions, among them a demonic version of himself, symbiotic illusions of [Order 66](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Order_66/Legends "Order 66/Legends"), the deaths of Jedi [Mace Windu](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mace_Windu/Legends "Mace Windu/Legends") and [Ahsoka Tano](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ahsoka_Tano/Legends "Ahsoka Tano/Legends"), the actual ghost of [Darth Bane](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Bane/Legends "Darth Bane/Legends"), and a cliffhanger duel with the two Sith alongside [Anakin Skywalker](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker/Legends "Anakin Skywalker/Legends").

After beheading him, Hett was called by the spirit of the ancient Sith Lord, [XoXaan](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/XoXaan "XoXaan"), who taught him the secrets of the ancient Sith.

Korriban

Shortly after the [Battle of Yavin](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Yavin/Legends "Battle of Yavin/Legends"), [Palpatine](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Palpatine/Legends "Palpatine/Legends"), now Emperor of the Galactic Empire and the ruling Dark Lord of the Sith, visited the tombs of the ancient Sith Lords on Korriban that were still haunted by the ghosts of the long deceased Sith. He wanted to gain further knowledge of the dark side, but his demands only enraged the mummified Sith. Wounded and cowed, he was rescued by [Jeng Droga](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jeng_Droga "Jeng Droga") and had to recover from the assault in a [bacta tank](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bacta_tank/Legends "Bacta tank/Legends") on [Imperial Center](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant/Legends "Coruscant/Legends").<sup id="cite_ref-SWGamer5_26-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-SWGamer5-26">[26]</a></sup>

During this time, the [Zann Consortium](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Zann_Consortium/Legends "Zann Consortium/Legends") had the option of setting up operations on the planet for knowledge.<sup id="cite_ref-Empire_at_War:_Forces_of_Corruption_27-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-Empire_at_War:_Forces_of_Corruption-27">[27]</a></sup> During a pilgrimage to Korriban shortly before the [Battle of Endor](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Endor/Legends "Battle of Endor/Legends"), [Emperor](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Emperor/Legends "Emperor/Legends") Palpatine suffered an [ambush](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Korriban_(Galactic_Civil_War) "Battle of Korriban (Galactic Civil War)") from the Rebel Alliance's [Renegade Squadron](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Renegade_Squadron/Legends "Renegade Squadron/Legends"). After trapping him in one of the tombs temporarily, and suffering casualties in doing so, the Squadron were able to infiltrate his landing craft and obtain information about the [second Death Star](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Star_II/Legends "Death Star II/Legends"), information that would bring about the tyrant's [fall](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Endor/Legends "Battle of Endor/Legends").

A tomb intended for Darth Vader that, after his defection from the Sith before his death, was offered by the Sith spirits to Darth Sidious, was presumably erected sometime during this period.<sup id="cite_ref-Empire's_End_28-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-Empire's_End-28">[28]</a></sup> Another burial chamber was built for Naga Sadow thousands of years ago but was never occupied because Sadow died [offworld](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin_4/Legends "Yavin 4/Legends").<sup id="cite_ref-kotor_13-5"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-kotor-13">[13]</a></sup>

### New Republic\[\]

"*So we're going to Korriban, huh? Not exactly a vacation spot.*"
"*Korriban? Never heard of it.*"
"*It's the burial place of a whole bunch of Sith Lords.*"

At [11 ABY](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/11_ABY/Legends "11 ABY/Legends"), Palpatine visited the planet once again for the last time, in order to restore his decaying [clone](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cloning/Legends "Cloning/Legends") body. He conferred with the Sith spirits, who discouraged his decision to try and save his life, offering him a seat among their mummified remains, the tomb-throne reserved for Vader (the Emperor presumably had no tomb prepared for himself on Korriban because he did not intend to ever die).

A [Star Destroyer](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Destroyer/Legends "Star Destroyer/Legends") over Korriban

Darth Sidious insisted that he should live, and the deceased Dark Lords informed him that, although his last body could not be saved, he could survive by using fresh Jedi blood, possessing the newborn [Anakin Solo](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Anakin_Solo "Anakin Solo"). He did not succeed in his attempt to do so, and lost his final clone body on [Onderon](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Onderon/Legends "Onderon/Legends") shortly after.<sup id="cite_ref-Empire's_End_28-1"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-Empire's_End-28">[28]</a></sup>

Later, in [14 ABY](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/14_ABY/Legends "14 ABY/Legends") a cult known as the [Disciples of Ragnos](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Disciples_of_Ragnos "Disciples of Ragnos") arrived on Korriban under the leadership of the [Dark Jedi](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Jedi/Legends "Dark Jedi/Legends") [Tavion Axmis](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tavion_Axmis "Tavion Axmis") of the [Empire Reborn](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Empire_Reborn "Empire Reborn"), hoping to resurrect the ancient Sith Lord [Marka Ragnos](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Marka_Ragnos "Marka Ragnos"). However, their plans were being slowly uncovered by several Jedi, most notably by [Luke Skywalker](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Luke_Skywalker/Legends "Luke Skywalker/Legends"), [Kyle Katarn](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kyle_Katarn "Kyle Katarn"), and his two students: [Jaden Korr](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jaden_Korr "Jaden Korr") and [Rosh Penin](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rosh_Penin "Rosh Penin"). Eventually, the trails led the Jedi to Korriban. One of the greatest Jedi battles of the time, the [Battle of Korriban](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Korriban_(Disciples_of_Ragnos_crisis) "Battle of Korriban (Disciples of Ragnos crisis)") concluded when Jaden Korr defeated Marka Ragnos's spirit in Tavion's body. Following Axmis' defeat, [Imperial support](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_Remnant "Imperial Remnant") was withdrawn and the Disciples crumbled.<sup id="cite_ref-jk-ja_29-1"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-jk-ja-29">[29]</a></sup>

Years later, Hett finally emerged from his long tutelage under XoXaan, intent on defeating Sidious and Vader, only to learn that they had been defeated and dead. Realizing he went through all that for nothing, he escaped into the [Unknown Regions](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Unknown_Regions/Legends "Unknown Regions/Legends"), determined to lose himself, where he met the [Yuuzhan Vong](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Yuuzhan_Vong "Yuuzhan Vong").

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/4/45/JKAlevelshot_kor2.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/225?cb=20080508050925)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/4/45/JKAlevelshot_kor2.png/revision/latest?cb=20080508050925)

The [Valley of the Dark Lords](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Valley_of_the_Dark_Lords/Legends "Valley of the Dark Lords/Legends") during the [Battle of Korriban](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Korriban_(Disciples_of_Ragnos_crisis) "Battle of Korriban (Disciples of Ragnos crisis)")

The New Jedi Order also revisited the planet on other occasions. At one time, Luke Skywalker sent some Jedi Academy researchers to Korriban, where they discovered the logs of the *[Jynni's Virtue](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jynni%27s_Virtue "Jynni's Virtue")*.<sup id="cite_ref-wizards_3-21"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-wizards-3">[3]</a></sup> The time codes on the log indicated it was recorded just before the [Battle of Yavin](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Yavin/Legends "Battle of Yavin/Legends"), however they were found sealed in a 7,000 -year-old tomb.

### Rule of the One Sith\[\]

Korriban was apparently untouched by the [Yuuzhan Vong War](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Yuuzhan_Vong_War "Yuuzhan Vong War"), as [Darth Krayt](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Krayt "Darth Krayt") and his [One Sith](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/One_Sith "One Sith") used it as their headquarters starting around [30 ABY](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/30_ABY/Legends "30 ABY/Legends"). Until [127 ABY](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/127_ABY "127 ABY"), they remained relatively hidden, acting behind the shadows like Palpatine did.

In [40 ABY](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/40_ABY "40 ABY") [Alema Rar](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Alema_Rar "Alema Rar") went to Korriban to train under the Sith in order to help [Darth Caedus](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Caedus "Darth Caedus") focus himself after the death of Lumiya. Alema Rar met the Sith where after some persuasion was allowed to stay for a little while. Alema trained there and received [Darth Vectivus's holocron](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Holocron_of_Darth_Vectivus "Holocron of Darth Vectivus") filled with useless data to give to Jacen. They did not believe Jacen was essential to their plan and ultimately believed he would fail as he was not strong enough. Alema disagreed and believed these Sith were hiding while Caedus, a true Sith, took hold of the galaxy. The next year, [Kell Douro](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kell_Douro "Kell Douro"), an [Anzat](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Anzat_(species) "Anzat (species)") spy working for the One Sith, traveled to Korriban and met up with [Darth Wyyrlok](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Wyyrlok_(I) "Darth Wyyrlok (I)").

Some years before [44 ABY](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/44_ABY "44 ABY"), Luke Skywalker had all navigation data about Korriban banned from Jedi computers, and had asked the [Galactic Alliance](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Federation_of_Free_Alliances "Galactic Federation of Free Alliances") to do the same. Despite this, enough information was found in ancient, locked-up records, allowing Luke, [Ben Skywalker](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ben_Skywalker "Ben Skywalker"), [Jaina Solo](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jaina_Solo_Fel "Jaina Solo Fel"), and [Vestara Khai](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vestara_Khai "Vestara Khai") to get to Korriban while looking for the [Lost Tribe of Sith](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lost_Tribe_of_Sith "Lost Tribe of Sith").<sup id="cite_ref-Ascension_30-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-Ascension-30">[30]</a></sup>

[Darth Krayt](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Krayt "Darth Krayt") on Korriban during the New Republic's reign.

In [137 ABY](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/137_ABY "137 ABY"), Krayt returned to Korriban to demand to the ancient Sith Lords, [Darth Nihilus](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Nihilus "Darth Nihilus"), [Darth Andeddu](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Andeddu "Darth Andeddu") and [Darth Bane](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Bane/Legends "Darth Bane/Legends") to give him the teachings to heal him or at least slow down the Vong growths on his body, but the ghosts refused to give him aid. Their magic caused the Vong armor he wore to make him into [a creature much like his namesake](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Krayt_dragon/Legends "Krayt dragon/Legends"). The current Dark Lord refused to accept his destiny and dispelled the magic.<sup id="cite_ref-Broken_4_31-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-Broken_4-31">[31]</a></sup>

Months later, when Krayt was [defeated](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_on_Had_Abbadon "Battle on Had Abbadon") on [Had Abbadon](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Had_Abbadon/Legends "Had Abbadon/Legends") and assassinated by [Darth Wyyrlok](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Wyyrlok_(III) "Darth Wyyrlok (III)"), his body was entombed within the ancient [Temple](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/XoXaan%27s_Temple "XoXaan's Temple") of XoXaan, kept in a [stasis chamber](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Stasis_Room "Stasis Room") so that the other Sith wouldn't suspect their master's demise. At the same time, [Marasiah Fel](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Marasiah_Fel "Marasiah Fel") was abducted and taken prisoner at the planet and [Darth Maladi](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Maladi "Darth Maladi") sent [Darth Nihl](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Nihl "Darth Nihl") to the planet to verify if Darth Krayt was still alive or if he was dead. The two Sith Lords had become disillusioned with Darth Wyyrlok's handling of the Order and the [Empire](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Krayt%27s_Galactic_Empire "Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire").

Following the final death of Darth Krayt at the [Battle of Coruscant](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Coruscant_(Second_Imperial_Civil_War) "Battle of Coruscant (Second Imperial Civil War)") and the subsequent collapse of Krayt's Empire, all of the [Sith troopers](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Krayt%27s_Sith_trooper "Darth Krayt's Sith trooper") housed on Korriban went berserk and attempted to kill everyone around them. Those Sith that could, fled; those who could not were slain.<sup id="cite_ref-SWLG6_32-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-SWLG6-32">[32]</a></sup>

## Fauna\[\]

Due to the planet's harsh terrain, and the power of the dark side, Korriban's native fauna was both vicious and cunning, such as the fierce [terentateks](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Terentatek/Legends "Terentatek/Legends"). The bat-like [shyracks](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Shyrack/Legends "Shyrack/Legends") lived in great numbers in caves on the planet. [Tuk'ata](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tuk%27ata/Legends "Tuk'ata/Legends"), sometimes called Sith hounds were also fairly common, particularly in the Valley of the Dark Lords. Dark side dragons, or [Hssiss](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hssiss "Hssiss"), could be found on Korriban, though as semi-aquatic creatures, they were quite rare. [Wraids](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Wraid "Wraid") were also found on Korriban. There is evidence that, at one point, the planet was home to an ape or primate-like species, although by the time of Naga Sadow the species was long extinct. Though it is possible that the primate-like species was somehow connected to the Sith species, no conclusive link between this species and the Sith species was known. The highly venomous [pelko bug](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Pelko_bug "Pelko bug") was an insect native to the planet—its venom had a potent numbing effect and was used in [Sith training sabers](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_training_saber "Sith training saber") by the Brotherhood of Darkness during the end of the New Sith War. By the time of the [Cold War](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cold_War_(Galactic_Republic%E2%80%93Sith_Empire) "Cold War (Galactic Republic–Sith Empire)"), [K'lor'slugs](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/K%27lor%27slug/Legends "K'lor'slug/Legends") could also be found on Korriban.<sup id="cite_ref-TOR_21-7"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-TOR-21">[21]</a></sup>

## Locations\[\]

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/f/f1/Fearful_Landscape_CotG.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20170404062429)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/f/f1/Fearful_Landscape_CotG.png/revision/latest?cb=20170404062429)

Valley of the Dark Lords

The [Valley of the Dark Lords](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Valley_of_the_Dark_Lords/Legends "Valley of the Dark Lords/Legends") was a valley and burial ground of Korriban's [Sith Lords](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Lord/Legends "Sith Lord/Legends"). Originally constructed by the planet's natives as a burial ground for their kings; the [Exiles](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Exiles "Exiles") of the [Jedi Order](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Order/Legends "Jedi Order/Legends") who came to be known as the [Dark Lord of the Sith](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Lord_of_the_Sith/Legends "Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends") added their own tombs to the Valley. Along with several prominent tombs, the Valley was home to the ancient [Sith](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sith/Legends "Sith/Legends") [Great Temple](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Temple_(Korriban) "Great Temple (Korriban)") and [Lord Khreusis's Stronghold](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lord_Khreusis%27s_stronghold "Lord Khreusis's stronghold") which would loom over the Valley for several millennia.

### Sith Academy\[\]

[![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/d/d4/Sith_Academy_Entrance.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20080527134843)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/d/d4/Sith_Academy_Entrance.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080527134843)

The Academy during the Jedi Civil War

The [Sith Academy](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Academy_(Korriban) "Sith Academy (Korriban)") was a facility in use since the [Jedi Civil War](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Civil_War "Jedi Civil War"), dedicated to training Force sensitives in the ways of the Sith, and running archaeological projects in the Valley of the Dark Lords.

### Korriban Arrival Port\[\]

The [Korriban Arrival Port](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban_Arrival_Port "Korriban Arrival Port") was the main [spaceport](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Spaceport/Legends "Spaceport/Legends") of Korriban during the [Cold War](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cold_War_(Galactic_Republic%E2%80%93Sith_Empire) "Cold War (Galactic Republic–Sith Empire)"). It was near the Academy and the Valley of the Dark Lords and was mostly used for shuttles to drop potential [acolytes](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Acolyte "Sith Acolyte") who were then taken to the Academy. There, their respective training [overseers](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_(Sith) "Overseer (Sith)") would meet and brief them on the basics of [Sith training](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_training "Sith training").<sup id="cite_ref-TOR_21-8"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-TOR-21">[21]</a></sup>

### Valley of Golg\[\]

The Valley of Golg was one of many burial valleys constructed on Korriban by the ancient Sith Empire. It was located near the planet's equator.

## Behind the scenes\[\]

"*Without Adas' unifying influence, wars once again raged for rule of the Sith people, with the reigning combatants arrogantly claiming the title of Sith'ari, and eventually forcing a relocation of the Sith capitol to the planet Ziost. Eventually, almost two-dozen millennia after Adas' death, a proper successor to Adas seemed to come at last. Known in Republic space as the Exiles, traitorous Jedi defeated in a galactic war called the Hundred-Year Darkness arrived on Korriban and cowed the Sith people with their astounding Force abilities, lightsabers, and superior technology.*"

Concept art of Korriban for *Star Wars: The Old Republic*

Korriban first appeared in [*Tales of the Jedi – Dark Lords of the Sith* 2](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tales_of_the_Jedi_%E2%80%93_Dark_Lords_of_the_Sith_2 "Tales of the Jedi – Dark Lords of the Sith 2"). The name of the planet was conceived by [Kevin J. Anderson](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kevin_J._Anderson "Kevin J. Anderson").<sup id="cite_ref-Veitch_Interview_33-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban#cite_note-Veitch_Interview-33">[33]</a></sup>

Though [Ziost](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ziost/Legends "Ziost/Legends") was established as the original Sith homeworld in *[Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi — The Golden Age of the Sith](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Tales_of_the_Jedi_%E2%80%94_The_Golden_Age_of_the_Sith "Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi — The Golden Age of the Sith")*, many sources described Korriban as the Sith homeworld. It was the "public" capital world of the [Sith Empire](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Revan%27s_Sith_Empire "Darth Revan's Sith Empire") during the era of Darth Revan, but was a mausoleum-world for millennia beforehand and would return to such a state not long after.

The controversy was put to rest in the article *[Evil Never Dies: The Sith Dynasties](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Evil_Never_Dies:_The_Sith_Dynasties "Evil Never Dies: The Sith Dynasties")* by [Abel G. Peña](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Abel_G._Pe%C3%B1a "Abel G. Peña"), which clearly established the Sith originating on Korriban and relocating the capital to Ziost before the arrival of the Dark Jedi exiles during the [Hundred-Year Darkness](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hundred-Year_Darkness/Legends "Hundred-Year Darkness/Legends"), though the Dark Jedi exiles themselves landed on Korriban.

In [*Star Wars: The Force Unleashed*](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Force_Unleashed_(video_game) "Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (video game)"), entering the word "KORRIBAN" in the "Input Code" section unlocks the [Sith stalker armor](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_stalker_armor "Sith stalker armor").

Korriban appears in the final episodes of *[Star Wars: The Clone Wars](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Clone_Wars "Star Wars: The Clone Wars")*. [George Lucas](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/George_Lucas "George Lucas") preferred the name "Moraband" to Korriban during story development, leading the episode "[Sacrifice](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sacrifice "Sacrifice")" to refer to the planet as Moraband. The episode guide's trivia gallery clarified the issue, stating that Korriban has had multiple names throughout its history, suggesting that both names are equally as valid.
