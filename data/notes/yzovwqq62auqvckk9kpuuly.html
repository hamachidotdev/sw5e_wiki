<p>When you served under a master, you would often hear secrets that weren’t meant for your ears. Back then, however, you weren’t alive. You have insider knowledge on your previous owner or perhaps others who passed through your area. This knowledge may be used for leverage, revenge, or other means, at the discretion of your GM. This knowledge, while it may prove useful in your adventure, may also make you a target for those whose secrets you possess.</p>
