<p><a href="https://sw5e.com/loot/enhancedItems">List of Customizations (filter by type)</a></p>
<p>Droid customizations are items that can enhance a droid in some way. They come in the form of parts, which replace a physical droid part, or protocols, which enhance the droid’s functions in some way. Droid customizations are discussed later in this chapter.</p>
<h4 id="customizing-droids"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#customizing-droids"></a><a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/wh/enhancedItems#customizing-droids"></a>Customizing Droids</h4>
<p>Customizing a droid with droid-specific equipment requires three key components: a droid with a valid slot for the equipment, a piece of equipment to install, and astrotech’s implements. A droid can only be customized by someone with proficiency in astrotech’s implements.</p>
<h4 id="valid-targets"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#valid-targets"></a><a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/wh/enhancedItems#valid-targets-2"></a>Valid Targets</h4>
<p>Only droids are valid targets for droid customizations. A droid’s motor can support two droid customizations, and can be upgraded to support up to six customizations.</p>
<h4 id="customization-time"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#customization-time"></a><a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/wh/enhancedItems#customization-time"></a>Customization Time</h4>
<p>It takes 8 hours to install a customization in a Medium droid. The time it takes to install a customization in a droid of another size varies based on the size of the target, as shown in the Droid Size Time Modifier table below.</p>
<h5 id="droid-size-time-modifier"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#droid-size-time-modifier"></a><a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/wh/enhancedItems#droid-size-time-modifier"></a>Droid Size Time Modifier</h5>
<p>| Droid Size | Time Modifier |</p>
<p>| --- | --- |</p>
<p>| Tiny | x 0.25 |</p>
<p>| Small | x 0.5 |</p>
<p>| Medium | x 1 |</p>
<p>| Large | x 2 |</p>
<p>| Huge | x 5 |</p>
<p>| Gargantuan | x 10 |</p>
<p>For instance, to install a customization in a Medium droid takes 8 hours. To install an augmentation in a Huge droid, however, it takes 40 hours (5 x 8).</p>
<p>The installer works 8 hours per day. It costs 100 credits per hour if the operation is performed by an NPC.</p>
<h4 id="motor-upgrading"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#motor-upgrading"></a><a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/wh/enhancedItems#motor-upgrading"></a>Motor Upgrading</h4>
<p>A droid’s motor can be upgraded to support more customizations, up to a maximum of six customizations. To upgrade the motor in a Medium droid, it takes 8 hours and a number of credits depending on the total number of slots the upgraded motor grants, as shown below in the Total Slots Upgrade Cost table.</p>
<h5 id="total-slots-upgrade-cost"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#total-slots-upgrade-cost"></a><a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/wh/enhancedItems#total-slots-upgrade-cost"></a>Total Slots Upgrade Cost</h5>
<p>| Total Slots | Upgrade Cost |</p>
<p>| --- | --- |</p>
<p>| 3 | 2,000 cr |</p>
<p>| 4 | 10,000 cr |</p>
<p>| 5 | 50,000 cr |</p>
<p>| 6 | 200,000 cr |</p>
<p>The time and cost it takes to upgrade a motor in a droid of another size varies based on the size of the target, as shown in the Droid Size Time Modifier table.</p>
<p>For instance, to upgrade a Medium droid’s motor from 2 slots to 3 slots, it takes 8 hours and 2,000 cr. To upgrade a Huge droid’s motor from 3 slots to 4 slots, however, it takes 40 hours (5 x 8) and 50,000 cr (5 x 10,000).</p>
<p>The installer works 8 hours a day. It costs 100 credits per hour if the operation is performed by an NPC.</p>
<h3 id="installing-customizations"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#installing-customizations"></a><a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/wh/enhancedItems#installing-customizations"></a>Installing Customizations</h3>
<p>In addition to the time and cost requirement, installing a customization requires an ability check with astrotech’s implements. The DC for the check is determined by the rarity of the customization being installed, as shown in the Installation/Removal DC by Rarity table on page __.</p>
<p>On a success, the customization is correctly installed. On a failure, the customization is not installed, the time and credits are spent, and you must wait 24 hours before you can try again.</p>
<h3 id="removing-customizations"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#removing-customizations"></a><a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/wh/enhancedItems#removing-customizations"></a>Removing Customizations</h3>
<p>Removing a customization takes half the time and credits it would to install, and requires an ability check with astrotech’s implements. The DC for the check is determined by the rarity of the customization being removed, as shown in the Installation/Removal DC by Rarity table on page __.</p>
<p>On a success, the customization is removed and salvaged. On a failure, the customization is removed but destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="customization-categories"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#customization-categories"></a><a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/wh/enhancedItems#customization-categories"></a>Customization Categories</h3>
<p>Two major categories of droid customizations exist in the galaxy: parts and protocols.</p>
<h4 id="parts"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#parts"></a><a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/wh/enhancedItems#parts"></a>Parts</h4>
<p>Parts typically enhance or replace the features of a droid. Additional arms, integrated shield generators or weapons, or built-in repulsor lifts. You can’t have more parts than your Strength, Dexterity or Constitution modifier (your choice, minimum of one).</p>
<h4 id="protocols"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#protocols"></a><a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/wh/enhancedItems#protocols"></a>Protocols</h4>
<p>Protocols bestow new abilities or improvements on the target droid. Typically, they take the shape of systems improvements and offer no visible indication that they exist. You can’t have more protocols than your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one).</p>
