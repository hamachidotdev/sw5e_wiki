They differ from class one droids because they apply the science to real-life situations. Class II droids are rarely equipped with Basic vocabulators, instead communicating through Binary. There are five subcategories of class II droids. Astromech, exploration, environmental, engineering, and maintenance droids are all class II droids.\n\n### Names\n\nDroids are typically called by their designation, given to them when they are created, or some affectation given to them by their owner. Often this affectation is a play on their designation.

The best and worst are found among them.\n\n**_Size._** Class II droids stand 2 to 4 feet tall and weigh about 70 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Small.\n\n**_Speed._** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.\n\n**_Type._** Your creature type is droid.\n\n**_Armor Integration._** You can not wear armor, but you can have the armor professionally integrated into your chassis over the course of a long rest. This work must be done by someone proficient with astrotech’s implements. You must be proficient in armor in order to have it integrated.\n\n**_Droid Resistances._** You are resistant to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage, and are immune to poison and disease.\n\n**_Droid Systems._** You do not need to eat or drink. Additionally, you no longer require a tech focus to cast tech powers.\n\n**_Droid Vulnerabilities._** You are vulnerable to ion damage. Additionally, you have disadvantage on saving throws against effects that would deal ion or lightning damage.\n\n**_Force-Insensitive._** While droids can be manipulated by many force powers, they can not sense the Force. You can not use force powers or take levels in forcecasting classes.\n\n**_Integrated Engineering._** You have proficiency in one specialist’s kit of your choice. The chosen kit is integrated into your chassis, and can not be removed while you are conscious. ^3afb20\n\n**_Maintenance Mode._** Rather than sleep, you must spend 3 hours performing routine maintenance during a long rest to gain its benefits, during which you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. Additionally, if your long rest would be interrupted, you only need to complete the long rest instead of restarting it.\n\n**_Rapid Reconstruction._** You are built with internal repair mechanisms. As a bonus action, you can choose to spend one of your Hit Dice to recover hit points.\n\n**_Skill Protocol._** You have proficiency in two skills of your choice. ^389fb5\n\n**_Undersized._** Your small stature makes it hard for you to wield bigger weapons. You can’t use heavy shields. Additionally, you can’t use martial weapons with the two-handed property unless it also has the light property, and if a martial weapon has the versatile property, you can only wield it in two hands.\n\n**_Languages._** You can speak, read, and write Binary. You can understand spoken and written Galactic Basic and one language of your choice, but you can not speak them.\n","n":0.042}}},{"i":41,"$":{"0":{"v":"Ships","n":1}}},{"i":42,"$":{"0":{"v":"Hyperspace","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n#### Astrogation\n\nPlotting a hyperspace course requires incredibly difficult calculations. Before jumping to hyperspace, a ship must plot a course via astrogation by completing 10 astrogation equations. When not under stress, a crewmember can take 10 minutes to carefully make these calculations and check them, resulting in automatic success. When under duress, such as in combat situations, a crewmember can calculate astronavigation with an Intelligence (Astrogation) check as an action on their turn, and then consults the **Astrogation Results** table.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/adventuring#astrogation-results)Astrogation Results\n\n| d20 | Result |\n| --- | --- |\n| 9 or lower | Your calculations fail, resulting in no completed equations. |\n| 10-15 | Your calculations are adequate, resulting in one completed equation. |\n| 16-20 | Your calculations include a breakthrough, resulting in two completed equations. |\n| 21-25 | Your calculations are excellent, resulting in three completed equations. |\n| 26-29 | Your calculations are masterful, resulting in four completed equations. |\n| 30+ | Your calculations are perfect, resulting in five completed equations. |\n\nAdditionally, the accuracy of the check is affected by how old the astrogation information is. If the astrogation information is less than a day old, the operator has advantage on the check. If the information is older than a week, however, they have disadvantage on the check.\n\nYou may choose to penalize your Intelligence (Astrogation) checks by 5 before making them in order to reduce your travel time by 24 hours; if this would reduce the travel time to less than 24 hours, you instead reduce the remaining travel time by one-half, to a minimum of 1 hour. You must restart your calculations if you change this course choice.\n\nAlternatively, you may gain a +5 circumstance bonus on your Intelligence (Astrogation) checks if you voluntarily double the travel time.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/adventuring#hyperspace-hazards)Hyperspace Hazards\n\nA jump to hyperspace can always be rushed, being made before all ten equations are completed, but such travel can be incredibly dangerous. If a starship is disabled because of a poorly plotted hyperspace course, the GM usually chooses the point at which the ship drops out of hyperspace at random. GMs looking for a more in-depth description of a hyperspace mishap can consult the table below. For every complete equation, add 1 to your roll on the table below. If you roll a 1 on your die, you roll again on the table in addition to suffering the indicated penalty.

Your character is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. You choose a species (such as human or twi’lek) and a class (such as sentinel or scout). You also invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of your character. Once completed, your character serves as your representative in the game, your avatar in the _Star Wars_ galaxy.\n\nBefore you dive into step 1 below, think about the kind of adventurer you want to play. You might be a courageous fighter, a skulking scoundrel, a fervent consular, or a cruel guardian. Or you might be more interested in an unconventional character, such as a brawny scoundrel who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who picks off enemies from afar. Do you like non-Human species like Twi’leks or Wookiees? Try building a character of one of those species. Do you want your character to be the toughest adventurer at the table? Consider the fighter class. If you don’t know where else to begin, take a look at the illustrations in any _Star Wars_ book to see what catches your interest.\n\nOnce you have a character in mind, follow these steps in order, making decisions that reflect the character you want. Your conception of your character might evolve with each choice you make. What’s important is that you come to the table with a character you’re excited to play.\n\nThroughout this section, we use the term character sheet to mean whatever you use to track your character, whether it’s a formal **character sheet** (like the one at the end of these rules), some form of digital record, or a piece of notebook paper. An official D&D character sheet is a fine place to start until you know what information you need and how you use it during the game.\n\n> ##### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#building-han-solo)Building Han Solo\n> \n> Each step of character creation includes an example of that step, with a player building the iconic character Han Solo, as he is portrayed during the events of Episode IV.\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#1-choose-a-species)1\\. Choose a Species\n\nEvery character belongs to a species, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the _Star Wars_ worlds. The most common species in the galaxy is human, but there are a myriad of near-Human species available for play, including the four-armed Besalisks, the cunning Trandoshans, the dexterous Twi’leks, and the utilitarian droid. The **Species** chapter provides more information about these species.\n\nThe species you choose contributes to your character’s identity in an important way, by establishing a general appearance and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character’s species grants particular special traits, such as special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use minor powers.\n\nThese traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain classes (see step 2). For example, the special traits of Lanniks make them exceptional consulars, and Jawas tend to be powerful engineers. Sometimes playing against type can be fun, too. Ugnaught soldiers and Wookiee sentinels, for example, can be unusual but memorable characters.\n\nYour species also increases one or more of your ability scores, which you determine in step 3. Note these increases and remember to apply them later.\n\nRecord the traits granted by your species on your character sheet. Be sure to note your starting languages and your base speed as well.\n\n> ##### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#building-han-solo-step-1)Building Han Solo, Step 1\n> \n> Since Han Solo is a human, we record all the special traits of humans on our character, including his speed of 30 feet and the languages he knows: Galactic Basic and Shyriiwook.\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#2-choose-a-class)2\\. Choose a Class\n\nEvery adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a character’s vocation, what special talents he or she possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely to employ when exploring a city, fighting monsters, or engaging in a tense negotiation. The character classes are described in the **Classes** chapter.\n\nYour character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are **class features** - capabilities (including force- or tech-casting) that set your character apart from members of other classes. You also gain a number of **proficiencies**: armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies define many of the things your character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a convincing lie.\n\nOn your character sheet, record all the features that your class gives you at 1st level.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#level)Level\n\nTypically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by adventuring and gaining **experience points** (XP). A 1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring world, although he or she might have been a soldier or a pirate and done dangerous things before.\n\nStarting off at 1st level marks your character’s entry into the adventuring life. If you’re already familiar with the game, or if you are joining an existing D&D campaign, your GM might decide to have you begin at a higher level, on the assumption that your character has already survived a few harrowing adventures.\n\n> ##### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#quick-build)Quick Build\n> \n> Each class description in the Classes section includes a section offering suggestions to quickly build a character of that class, including how to assign your highest ability scores, a background suitable to the class, and starting powers.\n\nRecord your level on your character sheet. If you’re starting at a higher level, record the additional elements your class gives you for your levels past 1st. Also record your experience points. A 1st-level character has 0 XP. A higher-level character typically begins with the minimum amount of XP required to reach that level (see “Beyond 1st Level” later in this section).\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#hit-points-and-hit-dice)Hit Points and Hit Dice\n\nYour character’s hit points define how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your hit points are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit Point Dice).\n\nAt 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is determined by your class. You start with hit points equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your class description. (You also add your Constitution modifier, which you’ll determine in step 3.) This is also your **hit point maximum**.\n\nRecord your character’s hit points on your character sheet. Also record the type of Hit Die your character uses and the number of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see “Resting” in the Adventuring section). Whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, you add your Constitution modifier to the roll.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#proficiency-bonus)Proficiency Bonus\n\nThe table that appears in your class description shows your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level character. Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the numbers you’ll be recording on your character sheet:\n\n-   Attack rolls using weapons you’re proficient with\n-   Attack rolls with powers you cast\n-   Ability checks using skills you’re proficient in\n-   Ability checks using tools you’re proficient with\n-   Saving throws you’re proficient in\n-   Saving throw DCs for powers you cast (explained in each force- or tech-casting class)\n\nYour class determines your weapon proficiencies, your saving throw proficiencies, and some of your skill and tool proficiencies. (Skills are described in “Using Ability Scores”, tools in “Equipment.”) Your background gives you additional skill and tool proficiencies, and some species give you more proficiencies. Be sure to note all of these proficiencies, as well as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet.\n\nYour proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. Occasionally,\n\nyour proficiency bonus might be modified (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll or that it should be multiplied more than once, you nevertheless add it only once, multiply it only once, and halve it only once.\n\n> ##### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#building-han-solo-step-2)Building Han Solo, Step 2\n> \n> Han Solo is best depicted as an operative, so we make a note of the operative’s proficiencies and 1st-level class features on the character sheet.  \n> As a 1st-level operative, Han has 1 Hit Die-a d8-and starts with hit points equal to 8 + his Constitution modifier. Make a note of this; we will record the final number after we determine Han’s Constitution score (see step 3). Also make note of the proficiency bonus for a 1st-level character, which is +2.\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#3-determine-ability-scores)3\\. Determine Ability Scores\n\nMuch of what your character does in the game depends on his or her six abilities: **Strength**, **Dexterity**, **Constitution**, **Intelligence**, **Wisdom**, and **Charisma**. Each ability has a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.\n\nThe six abilities and their use in the game are described in the **Using Ability Scores** chapter. You generate your character’s six **ability scores** randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five more times, so that you have six numbers. If you want to save time or don’t like the idea of randomly determining ability scores, you can use the following scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.\n\nNow take your six numbers and write each number beside one of your character’s six abilities to assign scores to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes to your ability scores as a result of your species choice.\n\nAfter assigning your ability scores, determine your **ability modifiers** using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table. To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the result by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to each of your scores.\n\n> ##### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#building-han-solo-step-3)Building Han Solo, Step 3\n> \n> We will use the standard set of scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) for Han’s abilities. Han is talented and nimble, so we’ll put his highest score, 15, in Dexterity. His next-highest, 14, goes in Charisma. He then applies the 13 to Intelligence, the 12 to Constitution, the 10 to Wisdom and the 8 to Strength. After applying his special benefits (increasing Han’s Dexterity by 2, and his Intelligence and Charisma by 1), Han’s ability scores and modifiers look like this: Strength 8 (-1), Dexterity 17 (+3), Constitution 12 (+1), Intelligence 14 (+2), Wisdom 10 (+0), Charisma 15 (+2).  \n> We then fill in Han’s final hit points: 8 + his Constitution modifier of +1, for a total of 9 hit points.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#variant-customizing-ability-scores)Variant: Customizing Ability Scores\n\nAt your Game Master’s option, you can use this variant for determining your ability scores. The method described here allows you to build a character with a set of ability scores you choose individually.\n\nYou have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with, before applying special increases. You can’t have a score lower than 8.\n\nThis method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set of three high numbers and three low ones (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are above average and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 12), or any set of numbers between those extremes.\n\n##### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#ability-score-point-cost)Ability Score Point Cost\n\n| Score | Cost |\n| --- | --- |\n| 8 | 0 |\n| 9 | 1 |\n| 10 | 2 |\n| 11 | 3 |\n| 12 | 4 |\n| 13 | 5 |\n| 14 | 7 |\n| 15 | 9 |\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#4-describe-your-character)4\\. Describe Your Character\n\nOnce you know the basic game aspects of your character, it’s time to flesh him or her out as a person. Your character needs a name. Spend a few minutes thinking about what he or she looks like and how he or she behaves in general terms.\n\nUsing the information in the **Personality and Background** chapter, you can flesh out your character’s physical appearance and personality traits. Choose your character’s **alignment** (the moral compass that guides his or her decisions) and **ideals**. The **Personality and Background** chapter also helps you identify the things your character holds most dear, called **bonds**, and the **flaws** that could one day undermine him or her.\n\nYour character’s **background** describes where he or she came from, his or her original occupation, and the character’s place in the D&D world. Your GM might offer additional backgrounds beyond the ones included in the Personality and Background section, and might be willing to work with you to craft a background that’s a more precise fit for your character concept.\n\nA background gives your character a background feature (a general benefit) and proficiency in two skills, and it might also give you additional languages or proficiency with certain kinds of tools. Record this information, along with the personality information you develop, on your character sheet.\n\n##### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#ability-scores-and-modifiers)Ability Scores and Modifiers\n\n| Score | Modifier |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1 | \\-5 |\n| 2-3 | \\-4 |\n| 4-5 | \\-3 |\n| 6-7 | \\-2 |\n| 8-9 | \\-1 |\n| 10-11 | +0 |\n| 12-13 | +1 |\n| 14-15 | +2 |\n| 16-17 | +3 |\n| 18-19 | +4 |\n| 20-21 | +5 |\n| 22-23 | +6 |\n| 24-25 | +7 |\n| 26-27 | +8 |\n| 28-29 | +9 |\n| 30 | +10 |\n\n> ##### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#building-han-solo-step-4)Building Han Solo, Step 4\n> \n> We then fill in some of Han’s basic details: his name, his sex (male), his height and weight, and his alignment (chaotic light). His high Dexterity and Charisma represent his capability and power of presence, and his low Strength represent an unexceptional burliness.  \n> Han is a notorious scoundrel, so we choose the scoundrel background. Make a note of the proficiencies and special feature this background gives. We choose the Silver-Tongued feat for Han’s background feat, adding the bonus to Han’s Charisma, bring the total to 16, and the modifier to +3.  \n> We know that Han is both daring and rash, and has a propensity to gamble, so we choose the fourth and sixth personality traits. We choose the ideal of independence from the list in the background, noting that Han recognizes no one as his master.  \n> Han’s bond is his flight from Jabba the Hutt, so we choose the first option. His flaw is that he often chooses himself and his ship over others, so we choose the sixth option.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#your-characters-abilities)Your Character’s Abilities\n\nTake your character’s ability scores and species into account as you flesh out his or her appearance and personality. A very strong character with low Intelligence might think and behave very differently from a very smart character with low Strength.\n\nFor example, high Strength usually corresponds with a burly or athletic body, while a character with low Strength might be scrawny or plump.\n\nA character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and slim, while a character with low Dexterity might be either gangly and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.\n\nA character with high Constitution usually looks healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A character with low Constitution might be sickly or frail.\n\nA character with high Intelligence might be highly inquisitive and studious, while a character with low Intelligence might speak simply or easily forget details.\n\nA character with high Wisdom has good judgment, empathy, and a general awareness of what’s going on. A character with low Wisdom might be absent-minded, foolhardy, or oblivious.\n\nA character with high Charisma exudes confidence, which is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating presence. A character with a low Charisma might come across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#5-choose-equipment)5\\. Choose Equipment\n\nYour class and background determine your character’s **starting equipment**, including weapons, armor, and other adventuring gear. Record this equipment on your character sheet. All such items are detailed in the Equipment section.  \nInstead of taking the gear given to you by your class and background, you can purchase your starting equipment. You have a number of **credits** (cr) to spend based on your class, as shown in the Equipment section. Extensive lists of equipment, with prices, also appear in that section.\n\nYour Strength score limits the amount of gear you can carry. Try not to purchase equipment with a total weight (in pounds) exceeding your Strength score times 15. “**Using Ability Scores**” has more information on carrying capacity.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#armor-class)Armor Class\n\nYour **Armor Class** (AC) represents how well your character avoids being wounded in battle. Things that contribute to your AC include the armor you wear, the shield you carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not all characters wear armor or carry shields, however.\n\nWithout armor or a shield, your character’s AC equals 10 + his or her Dexterity modifier. If your character wears armor, carries a shield, or both, calculate your AC using the rules in the Equipment section. Record your AC on your character sheet.\n\nYour character needs to be proficient with armor and shields to wear and use them effectively, and your armor and shield proficiencies are determined by your class. There are drawbacks to wearing armor or carrying a shield if you lack the required proficiency, as explained in the Equipment section.\n\nSome powers and class features give you a different way to calculate your AC. If you have multiple features that give you different ways to calculate your AC, you choose which one to use.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#weapons)Weapons\n\nFor each weapon your character wields, calculate the modifier you use when you attack with the weapon and the damage you deal when you hit.\n\nWhen you make an attack with a weapon, you roll a d20 and add your proficiency bonus (but only if you are proficient with the weapon) and the appropriate ability modifier.\n\n-   For attacks with **melee weapons**, use your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the finesse property, such as a vibrorapier, can use your Dexterity modifier instead.\n-   For attacks with **ranged weapons**, use your Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the thrown property, such as a vibrodagger, can use your Strength modifier instead.\n\n> ##### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#building-han-solo-step-5)Building Han Solo, Step 5\n> \n> We now write down the starting equipment from the operative class and the scoundrel background. His starting equipment includes a combat suit, giving him an Armor Class of 14.  \n> For Han’s weapons, we choose a vibrodagger and a light pistol. His light pistol is a ranged weapon, and the vibrodagger has the finesse property, so Han uses his Dexterity modifier for his attacks and damage. His attack bonus is his Dexterity modifier (+3) plus his proficiency bonus (+2), for a total of +5. The light pistol deals 1d4 energy damage, and Han adds his Dexterity modifier to the damage when he hits, for a total of 1d4+3 energy damage. The vibrodagger deals the same amount of damage, but is kinetic instead of energy.\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#6-come-together)6\\. Come Together\n\nMost _Star Wars_ characters don’t work alone. Each character plays a role within a **party**, a group of adventurers working together for a common purpose. Teamwork and cooperation greatly improve your party’s chances to survive the many perils in the worlds of _Star Wars_. Talk to your fellow players and your GM to decide whether your characters know one another, how they met, and what sorts of quests the group might undertake.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#beyond-1st-level)Beyond 1st Level\n\nAs your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by experience points.

This advancement is called gaining a level.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#class-features-and-hit-dice)Class Features and Hit Dice\n\nWhen your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can’t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character’s proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.\n\nEach time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total to your hit point maximum (minimum of 1 hit point). Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).\n\n##### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#character-advancement)Character Advancement\n\n| Experience Points | Level | Proficiency Bonus |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 0 | 1 | +2 |\n| 300 | 2 | +2 |\n| 900 | 3 | +2 |\n| 2,700 | 4 | +2 |\n| 6,500 | 5 | +3 |\n| 14,000 | 6 | +3 |\n| 23,000 | 7 | +3 |\n| 34,000 | 8 | +3 |\n| 48,000 | 9 | +4 |\n| 64,000 | 10 | +4 |\n| 85,000 | 11 | +4 |\n| 100,000 | 12 | +4 |\n| 120,000 | 13 | +5 |\n| 140,000 | 14 | +5 |\n| 165,000 | 15 | +5 |\n| 195,000 | 16 | +5 |\n| 225,000 | 17 | +6 |\n| 265,000 | 18 | +6 |\n| 305,000 | 19 | +6 |\n| 355,000 | 20 | +6 |\n\nWhen your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if your 7th-level soldier has a Constitution score of 17, when he reaches 8th level, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum then increases by 8.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#xp-and-proficiency-bonus-progression)XP and Proficiency Bonus Progression\n\nThe Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance in levels from level 1 through level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character of that level.

Voices chatter in countless different languages. The smells of cooking in dozens of different cuisines mingle with the odors of crowded streets and poor sanitation. Buildings in myriad architectural styles display the diverse origins of their inhabitants.\n\nAnd the people themselves-people of varying size, shape, and color, dressed in a dazzling spectrum of styles and hues-represent many different species, from diminutive bothans and stalwart cereans to majestic twi’leks and towering wookiees, mingling among a variety of human ethnicities.\n\nScattered among the members of these more common species are the true exotics: a hulking besalisk here, pushing his way through the crowd, and a sly chiss there, lurking in the shadows with mischief in her eyes. A group of jawas chatters as one of them activates a clever mechanical toy that moves of its own accord. Zabraks and devaronians live and work alongside humans, without fully belonging. And there, well out of the sunlight, is a lone dros-a fugitive from the the Galactic Republic, trying to make his way in a world.\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#choosing-a-species)Choosing a Species\n\nHumans are the most common people in the worlds of _Star Wars_, but they live and work alongside ithorians, kiffar, mirialan, and countless other fantastic species. Your character belongs to one of these peoples.\n\nYour choice of species affects many different aspects of your character. It establishes fundamental qualities that exist throughout your character’s adventuring career. When making this decision, keep in mind the kind of character you want to play. For example, a bothan can be a good choice for a sneaky operative, a wookiee makes a tough berserker, and a twi’lek can be a master of the Force.\n\nYour character species not only affects your ability scores and traits but also provides the cues for building your character’s story. Each species’ description in this chapter includes information to help you roleplay a character of that species, including personality, physical appearance, features of society, and special alignment tendencies. These details are suggestions to help you think about your character; adventurers can deviate widely from the norm for their species. It’s worthwhile to consider why your character is different, as a helpful way to think about your character’s background and personality.\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#special-traits)Special Traits\n\nThe description of each species includes special traits that are common to members of that species. The following entries appear among the traits of most species.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#ability-score-increase)Ability Score Increase\n\nEvery species increases one or more of a character’s ability scores.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#age)Age\n\nThe age entry notes the age when a member of the species is considered an adult, as well as the species’ expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#alignment)Alignment\n\nMost species have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your sith pureblood follows the light side, for example, in defiance of the Sith Empire can help you better define your character.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#size)Size\n\nCharacters of most species are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few species are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons and heavy shields, as explained in chapter 6.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#speed)Speed\n\nYour speed determines how far you can move when traveling (chapter 8) and fighting (chapter 9).\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#languages)Languages\n\nBy virtue of your species, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages. Each species typically speaks, or at least understands, Galactic Basic as well as having a unique language of their own. Chapter 4 lists the most common languages of the _Star Wars_ universe.","n":0.038}}},{"i":47,"$":{"0":{"v":"Introduction","n":1},"1":{"v":"The Dungeons and Dragons roleplaying game is about storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery. It shares elements with childhood games of make-believe. Like those games, D&D is driven by imagination. It’s about picturing the towering castle beneath the stormy night sky and imagining how a fantasy adventurer might react to the challenges that scene presents.\n\nThis overhaul is designed as a _Star Wars_ reskinning of the core Dungeons and Dragons experience. The rules are generally the same, and so an experienced player of 5th Edition should have no trouble jumping right in to a _Star Wars_ themed campaign. For the less experienced player, this Introduction will cover the basics of the 5th Edition of Dungeons and Dragons, appropriately reskinned for the setting.\n\n**Game Master (GM):** After traveling the streets of Nar Shaddaa, you find yourself at the entrance to the Black Sun compound. Security cameras scan the surrounding area, and a cadre of bored-looking guardsmen wait impatiently by the door. Two twi’lek urchins plead for handouts from the Black Sun mercenaries, only to be yelled at and pushed away. A shimmering barrier covers the entrance to the compound, with a manned security console on its left side.\n\n**Rickey (playing Vinto):** I want to talk my way into the compound. I approach the guards.\n\n**Drew (playing Dash):** I want to throw a grenade and then shoot them all.\n\n**Eric (playing Kodo):** …\n\nUnlike a game of make-believe, D&D gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the adventurers’ action. Players roll dice to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their\n\n**Game Master (GM):** OK, one at a time. Rickey, you’re approaching the guardsmen?\n\n**Rickey:** Yeah. Do they seem to be doing anything?\n\n**GM:** Make a Wisdom check.\n\n**Rickey:** Does my Perception skill apply?\n\n**GM:** Sure!\n\n**Rickey (rolling a d20):** Ugh. Seven.\n\n**GM:** You can see a couple of them crouching over the ground but you can’t make out what they’re doing. And Drew, Dash is prepping a grenade?\n\n**Drew:** Yup!\n\n**GM:** Okay. Eric, what’s Kodo doing?\n\n**Eric:** …\n\nadventurers can scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a Force-wielder’s shock, or pull off some other dangerous task. Anything is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.\n\nIn the _Star Wars_ Dungeons and Dragons game, each player creates an adventurer (also called a character) and teams up with other adventurers (played by friends). Working together, the group might explore a planet-encompassing city like Coruscant, the wilds of Kashyyyk, or the war-torn expanse of Oricon. The adventurers can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle the legendary Jedi or Sith, and discover special modified items and other treasure.\n\nOne player, however, takes on the role of the Game Master (GM), the game’s lead storyteller and referee. The GM creates adventures for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The GM might describe the entrance to a Black Sun compound, and the players decide what they want their adventurers to do. Will they charge in, guns blazing? Convince the guardsmen they belong there? Or use other means to find an entrance?\n\nThen the GM determines the results of the adventurers’ actions and narrates what they experience. Because the GM can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, D&D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can be exciting and unexpected.\n\nThe game has no real end; when one story or quest wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing story called a **campaign**. Many people who play the game keep their campaigns going for months or years, meeting with their friends every week or so to pick up the story where they left off. The adventurers grow in might as the campaign continues. Each force defeated, each adventure completed, and each relic recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also earns the adventurers new capabilities. This increase in power is reflected by an adventurer’s level.\n\nThere’s no winning and losing in _any_ Dungeons and Dragons game-at least, not the way those terms are usually understood. Together, the GM and the players create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront deadly perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious monsters or done in by a nefarious villain. Even so, the other adventurers can beseech a powerful Jedi to revive their fallen comrade, or the player might choose to create a new character to carry on. The group might fail to complete an adventure successfully, but if everyone had a good time and created a memorable story, they all win.\n\n## [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#worlds-of-adventure)Worlds of Adventure\n\nThe many worlds of the _Star Wars_ Dungeons and Dragons game are places of mysticism and monsters, of brave warriors and spectacular adventures. They begin with a foundation of science fiction and fantasy and then add the creatures, places, and mystery that make these worlds unique.\n\nNaturally, this conversion is designed to explore the myriad worlds of the _Star Wars_ universe. I personally designed it to be used in the Old Republic era as characterized by the **Knights of the Old Republic** games and **The Old Republic** MMORPG. Utilizing this timeframe allows greater justification for a prevalence of force-wielders.\n\nAll these worlds share characteristics, but each world is set apart by its own history and cultures, distinctive monsters and species, fantastic geography, ancient ruins, and scheming villains. Some worlds are dominated by one great story, like the Separatists’ war on Ord Mantell. Ultimately they’re all _Star Wars_ worlds, and you can use the rules in this book to create a character and play in any one of them.\n\nYour GM might set the campaign on one of these worlds or on one that he or she created. Because there is so much diversity among the worlds of _Star Wars_, you should check with your GM about any house rules that will affect your play of the game. Ultimately, the Game Master is the authority on the campaign and its setting, even if the setting is a canon world.\n\n## [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#using-this-book)Using This Book\n\nThe _Player’s Handbook_ is divided into twelve chapters.\n\n**Chapters 1-6** are about creating a character, providing the rules and guidance you need to make the character you’ll play in the game. It includes information on the various species, classes, backgrounds, equipment, and other customization options that you can choose from. Many of the rules in these chapters rely on material found later in the book. If you come across a game concept that you don’t understand, consult the book’s table of contents.\n\n**Chapters 7-9** details the rules of how to play the game, beyond the basics described in this introduction. It covers the kinds of die rolls you make to determine success or failure at the tasks your character attempts, and describes the three broad categories of activity in the game: exploration, interaction, and combat.\n\n**Chapters 10-12** is all about the Force and technology. It covers the nature of casting in the worlds of _Star Wars_, the rules for them, and the huge variety of powers available to characters in the game.\n\n## [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#how-to-play)How to Play\n\nThe play of the Dungeons and Dragons game unfolds according to this basic pattern.\n\n**1\\. The GM describes the environment.** The GM tells the players where their adventurers are and what’s around them, presenting the basic scope of options that present themselves (how many doors lead out of a room, what’s on a table, who’s in the cantina, and so on).\n\n**2\\. The players describe what they want to do.** Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying, “We’ll take the east door,” for example. Other times, different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might search a container while a second examines a symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for enemies. The players don’t need to take turns, but the GM listens to every player and decides how to resolve those actions.\n\nSometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer wants to walk across a room and open a door, the GM might just say that the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the GM decides what happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action.\n\n**3\\. The GM narrates the results of the adventurers’ actions.** Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back to step 1.\n\nThis pattern holds whether the adventurers are cautiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious noble, or locked in mortal combat against a mighty rancor. In certain situations, particularly combat, the action is more structured and the players (and GM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the adventure.\n\nOften the action of an adventure takes place in the imagination of the players and GM, relying on the GM’s verbal descriptions to set the scene. Some GMs like to use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood, and many players and GMs alike adopt different voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other characters they play in the game. Sometimes, a GM might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures to represent each creature involved in a scene to help the players keep track of where everyone is.\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#game-dice)Game Dice\n\nThe game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in many bookstores.\n\nIn these rules, the different dice are referred to by the letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d 10, d12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the typical cube that many games use).\n\nPercentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9. One die (designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100. Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and 0 is 100.\n\nWhen you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to add. For example, “3d8 + 5” means you roll three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.\n\nThe same d notation appears in the expressions “1d5”, “1d3” and “1d2.” To simulate the roll of a d5 or d3, roll a d10 or d6, respectively, and divide the number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending on whether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the number rolled is more than half the number of sides on the die, it’s a 2.)\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#the-d20)The D20\n\nDoes an adventurer’s vibroblade swing hurt a rancor or just bounce off its leathery hide? Will the guard believe an outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging river? Can a character avoid the main blast of a Sith’s _force storm_, or does he or she take full damage from the tempest? In cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain, the Dungeons and Dragons game relies on rolls of a 20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure.\n\nEvery character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six **ability scores**. The abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for most adventurers. (Monsters might have scores as low as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the **ability modifiers** derived from them, are the basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a character’s or monster’s behalf.\n\nAbility checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the rules of the game. All three follow these simple steps.\n\n**1\\. Roll the die and add a modifier.** Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and it sometimes includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character’s particular skill. (See chapter 1 for details on each ability and how to determine an ability’s modifier.)\n\n**2\\. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.** A class feature, a power, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.\n\n**3\\. Compare the total to a target number.** If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise, it’s a failure. The GM is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.\n\nThe target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a **Difficulty Class** (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an **Armor Class** (AC).\n\nThis simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in D&D play. Chapter 7 provides more detailed rules for using the d20 in the game.\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#advantage-and-disadvantage)Advantage and Disadvantage\n\nSometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is modified by special situations called **advantage** and **disadvantage**. Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a die roll, while disadvantage reflects the opposite. When you have either advantage or disadvantage, you roll a second die when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage on a d20 roll, roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17. More detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage are presented in chapter 7.\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#specific-beats-general)Specific Beats General\n\nThis book contains rules, especially in parts 2 and 3, that govern how the game plays. That said, many special traits, class features, powers, unique items, monster abilities, and other game elements break the general rules in some way, creating an exception to how the rest of the game works. Remember this: If a specific rule contradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.\n\nExceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, many adventurers don’t have proficiency with sniper rifles, but every Chiss does because of a special trait. That trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other examples of rule-breaking are more conspicuous. For instance, an adventurer can’t normally leap 30 feet, but some powers make that possible. The Force and technology account for most of the major exceptions to the rules.\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#round-appropriately)Round Appropriately\n\nFollow standard rules for rounding; if a number ends in one-half or greater, round up, while if a number ends in less than one-half, round down.\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#targets)Targets\n\nMany features and powers include specific language on what is a valid target, typically citing ally, friendly creature or hostile creature. The definition of each is included below.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#ally)Ally\n\nAn ally is any creature that would be considered friendly or neutral to you, but does not include you.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#friendly-creature)Friendly Creature\n\nA friendly creature is any creature that could be considered an ally to you, as well as you.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#hostile-creature)Hostile Creature\n\nA hostile creature is any creature that is antagonistic towards you.\n\n## [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#adventures)Adventures\n\nThe Dungeons and Dragons game consists of a group of characters embarking on an adventure that the Game Master presents to them. Each character brings particular capabilities to the adventure in the form of ability scores and skills, class features, special traits, equipment, and special items. Every character is different, with various strengths and weaknesses, so the best party of adventurers is one in which the characters complement each other and cover the weaknesses of their companions. The adventurers must cooperate to successfully complete the adventure.\n\nThe adventure is the heart of the game, a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. An adventure might be created by the Game Master or purchased off the shelf, tweaked and modified to suit the GM’s needs and desires. In either case, an adventure features a wonderous setting, whether it’s an underground enclave, a crumbling temple, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city. It features a rich cast of characters: the adventurers created and played by the other players at the table, as well as nonplayer characters (NPCs). Those characters might be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just background extras in an adventure. Often, one of the NPCs is a villain whose agenda drives much of an adventure’s action.\n\nOver the course of their adventures, the characters are confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and situations that they must deal with in some way. Sometimes the adventurers and other creatures do their best to kill or capture each other in combat. At other times, the adventurers talk to another creature (or even a mystical object) with a goal in mind. And often, the adventurers spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle, find something hidden, or unravel the current situation. Meanwhile, the adventurers explore the world, making decisions about which way to travel and what they’ll try to do next.\n\nAdventures vary in length and complexity. A short adventure might present only a few challenges, and it might take no more than a single game session to complete. A long adventure can involve hundreds of combats, interactions, and other challenges, and take dozens of sessions to play through, stretching over weeks or months of real time. Usually, the end of an adventure is marked by the adventurers heading back to safety to rest and enjoy the spoils of their labors.\n\nBut that’s not the end of the story. You can think of an adventure as a single episode of a TV series, made up of multiple exciting scenes. A campaign is the whole series-a string of adventures joined together, with a consistent group of adventurers following the narrative from start to finish.\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#the-force-and-technology)The Force and Technology\n\nFew _Star Wars_ adventures end without interacting with a force- or tech-caster. Whether helpful or harmful, powers appear frequently in the life of an adventurer, and it is the focus of chapters 10, 11, and 12.\n\nIn the worlds of _Star Wars_, practitioners of the Force are uncommon, set apart from the masses of people by their extraordinary talent.\n\nFor adventurers, though, the Force and technology are key to their survival. Without the healing prowess of a Jedi or a sawbones, adventurers would quickly succumb to their wounds. Without the uplifting support of a scholar, soldiers might be overwhelmed by powerful foes. Without the sheer power and versatility of a consular, every threat would be magnified tenfold.\n\nThe Force and technology are also a favored tool of villains. Many adventures are driven by the machinations of casters who are hell-bent on using power for some ill end. A mercenary leader subjugates the surrounding community, a renegade Sith saps the life from their victims, a vindictive droid takes over a space station with the intent of destroying its oppressors-these are just a few of the threats that adventurers might face. With power of their own, in the form of the Force and special items, the adventurers might prevail!\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#the-three-pillars-of-adventuring)The Three Pillars of Adventuring\n\nAdventurers can try to do anything their players can imagine, but it can be helpful to talk about their activities in three broad categories: exploration, social interaction, and combat.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#exploration)Exploration\n\nExploration includes both the adventurers’ movement through the world and their interaction with objects and situations that require their attention. Exploration is the give-and-take of the players describing what they want their characters to do, and the Game Master telling the players what happens as a result. On a large scale, that might involve the characters spending a day crossing the deserts of Tatooine or an hour making their way through the winding passages of an abandoned base. On the smallest scale, it could mean one character flipping a switch in a room to see what happens.\n\nSocial interaction features the adventurers talking to someone (or something) else. It might mean demanding that a captured scout reveal the least well guarded entrance to the mercenary base, getting information from a rescued prisoner, pleading for mercy from the leader of a group of criminals, or persuading an informant to garner information about a distant location.\n\nThe rules in chapters 7 and 8 support exploration and social interaction, as do many class features in chapter 3 and personality traits in chapter 4.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#combat)Combat\n\nCombat, the focus of chapter 9, involves characters and other creatures swinging weapons, casting powers, maneuvering for position, and so on-all in an effort to defeat their opponents, whether that means killing every enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat is the most structured element of a D&D session, with creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets a chance to act. Even in the context of a pitched battle, there’s still plenty of opportunity for adventurers to attempt wacky stunts like surfing down a flight of stairs on a shield, to examine the environment (perhaps by flipping a mysterious switch), and to interact with other creatures, including allies, enemies, and neutral parties.","n":0.017}}},{"i":48,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chapter 1 Step by Step Starships","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"## [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#chapter-1-step-by-step-starships)Chapter 1: Step-By-Step Starships\n\nYour first step in transitioning to the space portion of your _Star Wars_ 5th Edition campaign is imagining how having a starship impacts your character. When participating in the space portion of the game, your character is impacted by a number of features, including their chosen deployment, the size and style of ship on which they adventure, and the modification and equipment that ship has access to. These choices can enhance and enrich your avatar.\n\nBefore you dive into step 1 below, think about where your adventurer would be most likely to participate in a starship. You might be a dauntless pilot, or a crushing gunner. Perhaps you are a genius mechanic, an intricate operator, or a charming pilot. Maybe you are interested in a mixture of these roles.\n\nAdditionally, what kind of ship, and your intended purpose, can impact these decisions. Do you want to be a soldier in the Imperial Navy, piloting a TIE fighter and leading a squadron? Or are you more inclined to travel as a mercenary aboard a light freighter, taking jobs as you see fit in order to keep your ship in space? Maybe you instead want to be a bounty hunter in an assault craft, tracking your quarry to the Outer Rim, and beyond?\n\nOnce you have an idea in mind, follow these steps in order, making decisions that reflect the character and ship you want. Your conception of your character and starship might evolve with each choice you make. What’s important is that you come to the table with a character you’re excited to play.\n\nThroughout this section, we use the term **deployment sheet** and **starship sheet** to mean whatever you use to track your character, whether it’s a formal sheet (like the ones at the end of these rules), some form of digital record, or a piece of notebook paper. The official SW5e sheets are a fine place to start until you know what information you need and how you use it during the game.\n\n> ##### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#building-the-millennium-falcon)Building the Millennium Falcon\n> \n> Each step of ship/crew creation includes an example of that step, with a player building the iconic starship the Millennium Falcon, as it is portrayed during the events of Episode IV.\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#1-acquire-a-starship)1\\. Acquire a Starship\n\nA crew is nothing without its starship, and this chapter covers the acquisition and initial set up of starships. Like classes and deployments, starships have their own features that are driven by their size category. The **Starships** chapter provides more information about acquiring a starship, [Starship Size Categories](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#Starship%20Size%20Categories), and starship features.\n\nWhat starship you acquire is the second impactful decision you make when you adopt the space portion of your campaign. Each size category of starship has unique and tangible features, and determines what kind of crew your starship can support. A Small starship, for instance, can support 1-2 crew members at tier 0, while a Medium starship can support an entire adventuring party. At larger sizes, the crew shifts into the hundreds and thousands of crew members a ship can support.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#tier)Tier\n\nOnce you’ve obtained your starship - through any number of ways - you gain the ability to upgrade your ship. Typically, like deployments, starships are obtained at tier 0. A tier 0 ship is typically newly constructed, or otherwise not yet battle-tested or broken in.\n\nStarting off at tier 0 marks the beginning of your starship’s journey and evolution. Over time, with the use of resources and workers - and credits - a starship can be upgraded from tier 0 all the way up to tier 5, unlocking unique features - and choices - as it improves.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#hull-points-and-hull-dice)Hull Points and Hull Dice\n\nYour starship’s hull points define how tough your ship’s hull is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your hull points are determined by your Hull Dice (short for Hull Point Dice).\n\nAt tier 0, your starship has a varying quantity and size of Hull Dice, depending on its size category. Your starship starts with hull points equal to the highest roll of that die, as well as the average roll for each additional Hull Die. You also add your Constitution modifier to each die. This is your **hull point maximum**.\n\nRecord your starship’s hull points on your starship sheet. Also record the type of Hull Die your starship uses and the number of Hull Dice it has. After you conduct repairs - and at certain other points - you can spend Hull Dice to regain hull points (see “Repairs” in the Adventuring section).\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#shield-points-and-shield-dice)Shield Points and Shield Dice\n\nMost starships also have shields, although they do not come standard, and their strength - your ship’s **shield point maximum** - and the amount they can regenerate each round - your ship’s **shield regeneration rate** - is determined partially by your Shield Dice and partially by your choice of shields, detailed in the **Equipment** chapter. The number and type of shield dice normally parallels your Hull Dice.\n\n> ##### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#building-the-millennium-falcon-step-1)Building the Millennium Falcon, Step 1\n> \n> The Millennium Falcon is a heavily modified YT-1300f light freighter, and falls under the Medium size category. The ship starts at tier 0.  \n> As a tier 0 Medium ship, the Millennium Falcon has 5 Hull Dice - which are d8s - and a Constitution modifier of +1. Consequently, the Millennium Falcon has 33 hull points: 8 + the average for the subsequent four dice (5) + the Constitution modifier for each Hull Die (5 x 1).  \n> When the Millennium Falcon progresses to tier 1 it gains the following features: Starship Improvements and Evasive Maneuvers. We record Evasive Maneuvers on the starship sheet. Since the Millennium Falcon is fast, we increase its Strength with the Ability Score Improvement. It gains an additional Hull Dice, and it’s current and maximum hull points increases by 6. It also gains additional modifications, discussed in Chapter 4.  \n> Additionally, at tier 0, a Medium ship gets a choice of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throws proficiencies. For the Falcon, we choose Strength.\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#2-determine-ability-scores)2\\. Determine Ability Scores\n\nMuch of what your ship does in the game depends on its six abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each ability has a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.\n\nThe six abilities and their use in the game are described in the **Using Ability Scores** chapter. The Ability Score Summary table provides a quick reference for what qualities are measured by each ability. Ships size categories decrease and/or increase the base ability scores, as can tier advancements and ship modifications.\n\nYou generate your ship - s six ability scores using a standard array of ability scores that you assign to each ability as you wish (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma): 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. Afterward, make any changes to your ability scores as a result of your ship size.\n\nAfter assigning your ability scores, determine your ability modifiers using the [Ability Scores and Modifiers](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#Ability%20Scores%20and%20Modifiers) table. To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the result by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to each of your scores.\n\n> ##### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#building-the-millennium-falcon-step-2)Building The Millennium Falcon, Step 2\n> \n> We will use the standard set of scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) for the Falcon - s abilities. The Falcon is fast nimble, so we - ll put it’s highest scores, 15 and 14, in Strength and Dexterity, respectively. We then apply the 13 to Intelligence, the 12 to Constitution, the 10 to Wisdom and the 8 to Charisma. Because Medium ships have no ability score adjustments, The Falcon’s [Ability Scores and Modifiers](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#Ability%20Scores%20and%20Modifiers) look like this: Strength 15 (+2), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 12 (+1), Intelligence 13 (+1), Wisdom 10 (+0), Charisma 8 (-1).\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#variant-customizing-ability-scores)Variant: Customizing Ability Scores\n\nAt your Game Master - s option, you can use this variant for determining your ship’s ability scores. The method described here allows you to build a ship with a set of ability scores you choose individually.\n\nYou have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the [Ability Score Point Cost](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#Ability%20Score%20Point%20Cost) table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with, before applying special increases. You can - t have a score lower than 8.\n\nThis method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set of three high numbers and three low ones (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are above average and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 12), or any set of numbers between those extremes.\n\n##### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#ability-score-point-cost)Ability Score Point Cost\n\n| Score | Cost |\n| --- | --- |\n| 8 | 0 |\n| 9 | 1 |\n| 10 | 2 |\n| 11 | 3 |\n\n| Score | Cost |\n| --- | --- |\n| 12 | 4 |\n| 13 | 5 |\n| 14 | 7 |\n| 15 | 9 |\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#3-installing-modifications)3\\. Installing Modifications\n\nYour starship includes a number of standard modifi-cations, and can include more modifications - at the expense of credits, workers, and time - enhancing and augmenting the ship’s functionality. Modifications fall into five categories: engineering, operation, suite, universal, and weapon. The **Modifications** chapter provides more information about these categories and installation costs.\n\n> ##### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#building-the-millennium-falcon-step-3)Building the Millennium Falcon, Step 3\n> \n> At tier 0, the Millennium Falcon comes with one Barracks at no cost. Additionally, we choose a Living Quarters to give the crew their own rooms. We also choose the Recreation and Storage Compartment suites, bringing the total modifications to 3.  \n> The Millennium Falcon has dorsal and ventral cannons, so we choose two Fixed Hardpoints. Addi-tionally, these are turrets that can fire in a 360 degree arc, so we add two turreted hardpoints, both with di-rect control mods. We’re up to 9 modifications.  \n> She has a Hyperdrive and Navcomputer, bringing the total modifications to 11.  \n> Finally, the Falcon has exterior protection, so we take the Anti-Boarding System as our 12th mod.  \n> As Han gains credits, he continues to upgrade the ship, eventually installing an Improved Navcomputer modification, two weapon slave arrays to allow firing the turrets from the cockpit, and another fixed hardpoint.\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#4-choose-equipment)4\\. Choose Equipment\n\nStarships have access to certain types of equipment. Every starship has access to armor and shields as well as a reactor and a power coupling system, and most have access to weapons. Many starships, especially larger ones, have access to hyperdrives and navcomputers. The **Equipment** chapter provides more information on these categories.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#armor-class)Armor Class\n\nYour **Armor Class** (AC) represents how well your starship avoids being damaged in battle - either my avoiding being hit entirely or by remaining essentially unharmed from an attack. Your AC is determined by three major factors: your base AC, your starship’s Dexterity modifier, and the type of armor your ship has installed.\n\nYour ship has a base AC of 10 (without any plating modifications). You then add (or subtract) the two other factors above: Dexterity modifier, and a bonus or penalty to your ship’s AC based on armor chosen in the **Equipment** chapter.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#weapons)Weapons\n\nYour ship can have a number of weapons no greater than the number of fixed hardpoints it has. For each fixed hardpoint, a single weapon can be attached. When making attack rolls, or setting the save DC for ship weapons, we use the starship’s Intelligence modifier, and the ship’s proficiently equipped bonus. We also add the ship’s Strength modifier to damage rolls.\n\n> ##### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#building-the-millennium-falcon-step-4)Building the Millennium Falcon, Step 4\n> \n> The Millennium Falcon has a base AC of 10. With a Dexterity of 14, we add 2 to the Millennium Falcon’s base armor class. Additionally, the Falcon comes with deflection armor installed, which we will change out for lightweight armor, further increasing the AC to 14.  \n> The Falcon has two turreted hardpoints, and we choose traditional quad laser cannons to equip to them. When making an attack roll with either weapon, we use the ship’s Intelligence modifier (+1) and the ship’s proficiently equipped bonus (+3). When making a damage roll, we add the ship’s Strength modifier (+2). The fixed hardpoint is equipped with a missile launcher and is loaded with concussion missiles. The missile’s saving throw has a DC equal to 8 plus the ship’s Intelligence modifier (+1) and the ship’s proficiently equipped bonus (+3). We note that the quad laser cannons have an unlimited firing arc, do 2d4 + 3 energy damage, have a range of 800/3200, can fire in rapid mode, and overheat after shooting 8 shots. The concussion missiles have a limited firing arc, do 2d8 + 3 energy damage, have a range of 600/2400 and must fire in either burst 1 or rapid mode. These Falcon can fire 8 missiles before needing to be reloaded, and these missiles have the “explosive” feature, which will force concentration checks by characters on affected ships.\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#5-come-together)5\\. Come Together\n\nMost Star Wars characters don’t work alone, and while some starships can be operated by a single crew member, it is more dynamic - and engaging - to crew a starship with a _party_ - each member of the party fulfilling a needed role on the ship. Teamwork and cooperation greatly improve your party’s chance to survive the unapologetic lethality of spacefaring.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#deployments)Deployments\n\nThere are six major roles directly tied to the control of a starship: coordinator, gunner, mechanic, operator, pilot, and technician. Any character can have any one or more roles on the ship at any given time, but because there are only some functions a pilot can access, one character must be deployed as the pilot. How your character interacts with your ship - or enemy ships - is determined by what they decide to do on any particular turn, but characters will usually begin to focus on one or two particular roles. The **Deployments** chapter provides more information about each deployment.\n\nThe deployment you choose may be the first impactful decision you make when you adopt the space portion of your campaign. Each of the six deployments has a unique and tangible function, and many of them interact - and synergize - with your character’s species and class features. As you progress through the ranks of your chosen deployment, you unlock unique features that augment and enhance your interaction with that deployment, potentially granting you new actions, or simply improving the actions already available to your deployment.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#rank)Rank\n\nTypically, a character starts their space journey at deployment rank 0, and advances through the ranks (up to 5th) over time. A rank 0 character is typically inexperienced in the ways of their starship, although he or she might have been on a starship previously.\n\nStarting off at rank 0 marks your character’s entry in the spacefarer life. If you’re already familiar with the game, or if you are joining an existing SW5e campaign, your DM might decide to have you begin at a higher rank, on assumption that your character has already survived a few harrowing adventures. Record your rank on your deployment sheet. If you’re starting at a higher rank, record the additional elements your deployment specialization grants you.\n\n> ##### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#building-the-millennium-falcon-step-5)Building the Millennium Falcon, Step 5\n> \n> A ship is no good without a crew, especially her pilot: Han Solo in this case. Han is a versatile character aboard a ship, but he is strongest in the piloting role (best in the galaxy).  \n> When Han achieves his first rank, we spend that rank in the pilot deployment specialization, unlocking the Piloting Procedure and Venture deployment features. For his Piloting Procedure, we mark that Han’s power dice are d4s. Additionally, Han knows two tactics: for these we choose Koiogran Turn and Snap Roll. For his Venture, we choose Precision Gunner.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#beyond-the-basics)Beyond the Basics\n\nAs your characters - and their starship - go on adventures and overcome challenges, they can increase in their ranks and tiers, respectively. While tiers are driven by the amount of effort - and credits - directly applied to the starship, ranks are earned separately.\n\nTypically, characters start at deployment rank 0, achieving rank 1 after completing their first successful encounter and earning prestige. The GM may decide, however, that characters start at 1st rank or higher, depending on choices in a character’s background or during an adventure. Higher ranks are achieved by successfully completing more encounters and earning more prestige, as shown below in the [Deployment Rank Prestige](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#Deployment%20Rank%20Prestige) table.\n\n##### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#deployment-rank-prestige)Deployment Rank Prestige\n\n| DeploymentRank | TotalPrestige |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1st | 1 |\n| 2nd | 4 |\n| 3rd | 8 |\n| 4th | 12 |\n| 5th | 16 |\n\nAnything that requires the characters to exercise their skills yields prestige. Defeating, routing, or escaping an encounter are the most common methods, but other actions might yield prestige at the discretion of the GM; completing a training simulation or successfully talking your way out of a situation might earn you prestige, for instance.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#beyond-5th-rank)Beyond 5th Rank\n\nCharacters who reach 5th rank across their deployments may want to continue progressing in their starship skills. Additional prestige earned can yield additional ranks, though no character can gain higher than 5th rank in any deployment. For each rank beyond 5th, the amount of required prestige increases by 50; achieving 6th rank would require an additional 100 prestige (200 total), while achieving 7th rank would require an additional 150 prestige (350 total).\n\n> The expectation is to tie ranks - and hopefully tiers - to proficiency bonuses. When characters reach 5th-level, their proficiency bonus increases to 3, and again at 9th (4), 13th (5), and 17th (6). Ranks 2-4 are designed to be awarded at or around those same improvements.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#features-and-hullshield-dice)Features and Hull/Shield Dice\n\nWhen your starship gains a tier, it unlocks additional features, depending on its size, as detailed in the description. Some of these features allow you to increase your starship’s ability scores. You can’t increase an ability score above 20 unless otherwise noted.\n\nEach time your starship gains a tier, it gains gain 1 additional Hull Die and 1 additional Shield Die. Roll the Hull Die, add your ship’s Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total to your hull point maximum. Next, roll the Shield Die, add your ship’s Stength modifier to the roll, and add the total to your base shield points which is then multiplied by the appropriate factor depending on which shields your ship has. Alternatively, for both hull and shields, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).\n\nWhen your ship’s Constitution modifier increases by 1, its hull point maximum increases by 1 for each Hull Die it has. For example, if your tier 0 Medium ship has a Constitution score of 14, when it reaches tier 1, you increases its Constitution score from 14 to 16, thus increasing its Constitution modifier from +2 to +3. At tier 0, your Medium starship has a total of 6 Hull Dice, so its hull point maximum then increases by 6. The same rules apply to your base shield points and your Strength score.","n":0.018}}},{"i":49,"$":{"0":{"v":"Operator","n":1},"1":{"v":"# [The Operator](https://sw5e.com/starships/deployments/Operator)\n\n| Rank | Feature |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1st | Venture, Operational Control |\n| 2nd | System Disruption, Improved Interference |\n| 3rd | Disrupted Defenses, Threat Assessment |\n| 4th | Masterful Interference, Haywire |\n| 5th | Paragon Operator, Overload Systems |\n\n### Venture\n\nBeginning when you choose this deployment as your specialty, at 1st rank, and again at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank, you can choose a venture (see [[Chapter 6|game-references.chapter-6-customization-options#ventures]] for a list of ventures).\n\n### Operational Control\n\nAlso at 1st rank, you learn disruptions that are fueled by special dice called power dice.\n\n#### Disruptions\n\nYou learn two disruptions of your choice, which are detailed under “Disruptions” below. You can use only one disruption per turn, and you can only use each disruption once per round.\n\nYou learn an additional disruption at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank in this deployment. Each time you learn a new disruption, you can also replace one disruption you know with a different one.\n\n#### Power Dice\n\nA power die is expended when you use it. Your ship must have a power die at the required system in order to use the disruption.\n\nYour ship gains power dice based primarily on reactor production. These power dice are stored in a central and/or system capacitors to power abilities of deployed crew members. Your power die type is determined by your ship tier.\n\n#### Saving Throws\n\nSome of your Disruptions require your target to make a saving throw to resist the disruption’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:\n\n___\n\n**Disruption save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your ship’s Charisma modifier\n\n___\n\n### Disruptions\n\nThe collaborations are presented in alphabetical order.\n\n#### Enhance Scopes\n\n_**Power Die Location:** Sensors_\nAs a bonus action, can expend one power die to increase the ranges of your ship’s next primary or secondary weapon attack by 500 feet. If it hits, you add the power die to the attack’s damage roll.\n\n#### Disarming Shot\n\n_**Power Die Location:** Sensors_\nAs an action, you can expend one power die to attempt to disarm the target. You add the power die to your ship’s next attack roll. On a hit, in addition to the normal damage taken, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you disable a weapon of the target ship of your choice until the ship recharges.\n\n#### Hacked Communications\n\n_**Power Die Location:** Comms_\nAs an action, you may expend a power die, and choose any number of ships that you can see within 600 feet of you. Each ship must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take ionic damage equal to the number rolled on the die + your ship’s Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Additionally, on a failed save, the ship’s communication devices are disabled until rebooted.\n\n#### Reactor Vulnerability\n\n_**Power Die Location:** Comms_\nWhen a friendly ship hits a ship with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die as a reaction to temporarily destabilize the ship’s reactor. Add the number rolled to the damage of the weapon attack and the ship must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be shocked until the end of its next turn.\n\n#### Remote Sensors\n\n_**Power Die Location:** Sensors_\nWhenever you make a Wisdom (Scan) or an Intelligence (Probe) check, you can employ the aid of remote sensors by expending a power die, adding the number rolled to the check. You can use this maneuver before or after making the ability check, but before the results of the ability check are determined.\n\n#### Sensor Blast\n\n_**Power Die Location:** Comms_\nWhen a friendly ship hits a target with a weapon attack, you can expend one power die as a reaction to attempt to saturate the target’s sensors. You add the power die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than your ship until the end of your next turn.\n\n#### Systems Block\n\n_**Power Die Location:** Comms_\nWhen a friendly ship makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction and expend a power die and add it to the attack roll. On a hit, the target’s next attack has disadvantage and it cannot regain shield points until the start of your next turn.\n\n#### Targeted Strike\n\n_**Power Die Location:** Sensors_\nWhen a friendly ship makes an attack against a target, you can use your reaction to expend a power die. You add the power die to the attack roll, and the damage roll if it hits. You can use this maneuver before or after the attack roll, but before the GM determines whether or not the attack hits.\n\n### System Disruption\n\nAt 2nd rank, as a bonus action while deployed as an operator, you can choose a ship that you can see within 1,000 feet and target its systems for disruption. For the next minute, or until you disrupt another target, you have advantage on any Wisdom (Scan) or Intelligence (Probe) check you make to find it.\n\nAdditionally, when the ship makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to disrupt the ship’s functions. Roll a System Disruption die, which is a d6, and subtract it from the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. You can choose to use this feature after the ship makes its roll, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. You can use this feature twice. You gain another use of this feature at 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank in this deployment. You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\nYour System Disruption die changes when you reach certain ranks in this deployment. The die becomes a d8 at 3rd rank, a d10 at 4th rank, and a d12 at 5th rank.\n\n### Improved Interference\n\nAlso at 2nd rank, when you use take the Interfere action, you have advantage on the Charisma (Interfere) check. If you already have advantage, you can instead reroll one of the dice once.\n\n### Disrupted Defenses\n\nAt 3rd rank, the first time the target of your System Disruption takes damage each round, it takes additional damage equal to your System Disruption die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.\n\n### Threat Assessment\n\nAlso at 3rd rank, as a bonus action, you can learn certain information about the capabilities of the target of your System Disruption. The GM tells you if the ship is your ship’s equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:\n\n-   An ability score\n-   Armor Class\n-   Current total hull and shield points\n-   Total ship tiers (if any)\n-   Total deployment ranks (if any)\n\n### Masterful Interference\n\nAt 4th rank, when you take the Interfere action, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus. If you succeed on the check, the target has disadvantage on all ability checks or attack rolls it makes before the start of your next turn, instead of one.\n\n### Haywire\n\nAlso at 4th rank, when you target a ship with your System Disruption feature, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to Interfere checks). On a failed save, while it is the target of your System Disruption feature, the first time it makes an attack roll or a saving throw each round, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.\n\n### Paragon Operator\n\nAs of 5th rank, you are a paragon of your deployment. When you would expend a Power die or a System Disruption die, you can use a d4 instead of expending a die. You can only use this feature once per round.\n\nAdditionally, you regain all expended uses of your System Disruption feature when you finish a short or long rest.\n\nLastly, when you would make an Interfere, Scan, or Probe check while deployed as an operator, you can take the maximum instead of rolling. You can use this feature before or after making the roll, but before any effects of the roll are determined. Once you’ve used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\n\n### Overload Systems\n\nAlso at 5th rank, you learn how to overload the systems of a ship remotely. As an action, you can attempt to breach the systems of the target of your System Disruption. The ship must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to Interfere checks). On a failed save, the target’s flying speed reduced by half, it’s turning speed is doubled, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, it’s shields no longer regenerate, and it can’t use reactions.

Many gambits enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one gambit per attack, and you can only use each gambit once per turn.\n\nYou learn an additional gambit at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank in this deployment. Each time you learn a new gambit, you can also replace one gambit you know with a different one.\n\n#### Power Dice\n\nA power die is expended when you use it. Your ship must have a power die at the required system in order to use the gambit.\n\nYour ship gains power dice based primarily on reactor production. These power dice are stored in a central and/or system capacitors to power abilities of deployed crew members. Your power die type is determined by your ship tier.\n\n### Gambits\n\nThe gambits are presented in alphabetical order.\n\n#### Crippling Shot\n\n_**Power Die Location:** Weapons_\nWhen you hit a ship with a ship attack, you can expend one power die to cripple it. Add the power die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target ship’s flying speed is reduced by half until the end of their next turn.\n\n#### Disabling Shot\n\n_**Power Die Location:** Weapons_\nWhen you make a ship attack roll against a ship, you can expend one power die to add it to the roll. On a hit, the ship has disadvantage on the next ability check or attack roll it makes before the end of your next turn.\n\n#### Distracting Shot\n\n_**Power Die Location:** Weapons_\nWhen you hit a ship with a ship attack, you can expend one power die to give your allies an opening. You add the power die to the attack’s damage roll, and the next attack roll against the target by someone other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.\n\n#### Explosive Shot\n\n_**Power Die Location:** Weapons_\nWhen you reduce a ship to 0 hit points, you can expend one power die and use a bonus action on your turn to make one additional ship attack against a different ship within range. If that attack hits, add the power die to the attack’s damage roll.\n\n#### Expose Weakness\n\n_**Power Die Location:** Weapons_\nWhen you hit a ship with a ship attack, you can expend a power die and deal additional damage equal to the number rolled. This damage cannot be reduced in any way.\n\n#### Feinting Shot\n\n_**Power Die Location:** Weapons_\nYou can expend one power die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one ship within your primary weapon’s normal range as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that ship. If that attack hits, add the power die to the attack’s damage roll.\n\n#### Penetrating Shot\n\n_**Power Die Location:** Weapons_\nWhen you hit a ship with a ship attack, you can expend one power die to attempt to damage another ship with the same attack. Choose a second ship within 150 feet of and directly behind your initial target. If the original attack roll would hit the second ship, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your power die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.\n\n#### Precision Shot\n\n_**Power Die Location:** Weapons_\nWhen you make a ship attack roll against a ship, you can expend one power die to add it to the roll. If that attack hits, add the power die to the attack’s damage roll. You can use this power before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.\n\n### Gunning Style\n\nAt 2nd rank, you adopt a particular style of gunning as your specialty. Choose one of the Gunning Style options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can’t take a Gunning Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.\n\n### Improved Critical\n\nAlso at 2nd rank, your critical hit range with primary and secondary weapons increases by 1, and when a ship rolls a 1 on a saving throw against a tertiary or quaternary weapon that you control, they treat the effect’s damage as if it had rolled the maximum.\n\n### Dependable Gunner\n\nStarting at 3rd rank, when you roll for damage with a ship weapon, you can reroll one of the dice, but you must use the new result. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your ranks in gunner. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\n\n### Brutal Critical\n\nAlso at 3rd rank, you can roll the weapon damage dice one additional time when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a ship weapon.\n\n### Gunning Mastery\n\nAt 4th rank, you master a particular style of gunning. Choose one of the Gunning Mastery options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can’t take a Gunning Mastery option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.\n\n### Protean Gunner\n\nAlso at 4th rank, you can choose a second Gunning Style option.\n\n### Paragon Gunner\n\nAt 5th rank, when you would expend a power die, you can use a d4 instead of expending a die. You can only use this feature once per round.\n\nAdditionally, when you make an attack roll while deployed as a gunner, you can choose to make the roll a critical hit. You can use this feature before or after making the roll, but before any effects of the roll are determined. Once you’ve used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\n\n### Maximum Power\n\nAlso at 5th rank, when you hit a ship with a ship attack, you can deal maximum damage with that attack.\n\nOnce you’ve used this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\n","n":0.031}}},{"i":52,"$":{"0":{"v":"Classes","n":1}}},{"i":53,"$":{"0":{"v":"Engineer","n":1},"1":{"v":"## Engineer\n\nFlinching occasionally as a blaster bolt hits the nearby bulkhead, a Sullustan mechanic quickly solders a large wire. He peers through his tinted goggles, ignoring the shouts of his ship captain as the enemy descends on the hanger. Finally he shouts with pride as the repaired coupling powers up, causing the frigate to hum with energy. He gathers his tools and runs into the ship moments before it finally takes off.\n\nInside, the human captain jumps into the cockpit. She nods to her droid co-pilot, who quickly begins charting a course home. Before the calculations can be completed, enemy Starfighters scream in from the clouds. The pilot rolls the ship, nimbly evading incoming fire. She reroutes the power to shields, leaving just enough for astronavigation. Just as the energy reserves near depletion, the exosphere and stars beyond blur into streaks of light. In a flash, they warp to safety.\n\nA Cerean officer surveys the battlefield, looking for weaknesses. When he identifies a potential problem, he keys in a quick combination in his wristpad. In a blink, a custom suit of armor assembles itself around him. As the helmet locks into place, the officer leaps into the air, flying overhead and raining destruction on the opposition.\n\nEvery machine needs an engineer to run it, and a living crew is no different. Engineers are the experts and professionals who rely on skill, bravery, and their tools to survive and keep others alive. While they do not claim to be fighters, their mere presence can turn the tide of battle or simply keep operations running.\n\n### Behind the Curtain\n\nWhile perhaps not as intimidating as a heavily-armored trooper, or as exotic as a lighsaber-wielding guardian, engineers are no less vital to group dynamic. They are armorers and gunsmiths, electricians and welders, or any other facet to be found in facilities across the galaxy. Their work, often unsung, is what keeps starships (and their crew) intact.\n\n### Unflappable\n\nIt takes bravery for a soldier to enter a battlefield. It perhaps takes more for someone who is unarmed, and untrained in combat, to do the same. Engineers put their lives on the line for a living, whether by choice or acknowledging their plights as an occupational hazard. Whether they come from an elite training academy or learned their talents surviving in the slums, they are no strangers to danger and conflict.\n\nWhile creating your engineer character, consider what your primary skill set is and how you use it. You could be a street-smart mechanic who taught yourself how to fix swoop bikes as a teenager. Perhaps you are the recent graduate of an esteemed medical college, or a rookie pilot in the fledgling Rebel Alliance. What is the number one skill you are known for? Why are you willing to enter battles when you have no combat training? How do you view the more adventurous members of your group, and how do they see you and your role?\n\n#### Quick Build\n\nYou can make an engineer quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score. Your next-highest score should be Constitution. Second, choose the scientist background.\n\n## The Engineer\n\n| Level | Proficiency Bonus | Features | Tech Powers Known | Tech Points | Max Power Level | Potent Aptitude | Modification Slots |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | +2 | Techcasting, Potent Aptitude | 6 | 2 | 1st | d4 | \\- |\n| 2 | +2 | Infuse Item (+1), Tool Expertise | 7 | 4 | 1st | d4 | \\- |\n| 3 | +2 | Engineering Discipline | 9 | 6 | 2nd | d4 | 4 |\n| 4 | +2 | Ability Score Improvement | 10 | 8 | 2nd | d4 | 4 |\n| 5 | +3 | \\- | 12 | 10 | 3rd | d6 | 5 |\n| 6 | +3 | Discipline feature | 13 | 12 | 3rd | d6 | 5 |\n| 7 | +3 | \\- | 15 | 14 | 4th | d6 | 5 |\n| 8 | +3 | Ability Score Improvement | 16 | 16 | 4th | d6 | 5 |\n| 9 | +4 | \\- | 18 | 18 | 5th | d8 | 6 |\n| 10 | +4 | Infuse Item (+2) | 19 | 20 | 5th | d8 | 6 |\n| 11 | +4 | \\- | 21 | 22 | 6th | d8 | 7 |\n| 12 | +4 | Ability Score Improvement | 22 | 24 | 6th | d8 | 7 |\n| 13 | +5 | \\- | 23 | 26 | 7th | d10 | 8 |\n| 14 | +5 | Discipline feature | 24 | 28 | 7th | d10 | 8 |\n| 15 | +5 | Infuse Item (+3) | 25 | 30 | 8th | d10 | 8 |\n| 16 | +5 | Ability Score Improvement | 26 | 32 | 8th | d10 | 8 |\n| 17 | +6 | \\- | 27 | 34 | 9th | d12 | 9 |\n| 18 | +6 | Discipline feature | 28 | 36 | 9th | d12 | 9 |\n| 19 | +6 | Ability Score Improvement | 29 | 38 | 9th | d12 | 9 |\n| 20 | +6 | Tech Mastery | 30 | 40 | 9th | d12 | 9 |\n\n## Class Features\n\nAs a Engineer, you gain the following class features.\n\n#### Hit Points\n\n**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per Engineer level\n\n**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier\n\n**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per engineer level after 1st\n\n#### Proficiencies\n\n**Armor:** Light armor\n\n**Weapons:** Simple blasters, simple vibroweapons\n\n**Tools:** Tinker's implements, one of your choice\n\n**Saving Throws:** Constitution, Intelligence\n\n**Skills:** Choose three from Investigation, Lore, Medicine, Nature, Piloting, and Technology\n\n#### Equipment\n\nYou start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background\n\n-   _(a)_ a simple vibroweapon or _(b)_ a simple blaster and two power cells\n-   _(a)_ a dungeoneer’s pack or _(b)_ an explorer’s pack\n-   A combat suit, a set of tinker’s implements, a vibrodagger, and a wristpad\n\n#### Variant: Starting Wealth\n\nIn lieu of the equipment granted by your class and background, you can elect to purchase your starting gear. If you do so, you receive no equipment from your class and background, and instead roll for your starting wealth using the criteria below:\n\n  \n\n### Techcasting\n\n_**Engineer:** 1st level_  \nDuring your training you have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wristpad. See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.\n\n#### Tech Powers Known\n\nYou learn 6 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the engineer table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.\n\n#### Tech Points\n\nYou have a number of tech points equal to your engineer level x 2, as shown in the Tech Points column of the engineer table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.\n\n#### Max Power Level\n\nMany tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the engineer table.\n\nYou may only cast tech powers at 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\n\n#### Techcasting Ability\n\nIntelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. Additionally, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\n___\n\n**Tech save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\n\n___\n\n**Tech attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\n\n___\n\n#### Techcasting Focus\n\nYou use a wristpad (found in chapter 5) or the tools in which you are granted proficiency by this class as a tech focus for your tech powers.\n\n### Potent Aptitude\n\n_**Engineer:** 1st level_  \nYour technological experience lends you an uncommon insight that you can use to bolster your allies. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Potent Aptitude die, a d4. This die changes as you gain engineer levels, as shown in the Potent Aptitude column of the engineer table.\n\nOnce within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Potent Aptitude die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Potent Aptitude die is rolled, it is lost.\n\nA creature can have only one Potent Aptitude die at a time.\n\nYou can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\n\n### Infuse Item\n\n_**Engineer:** 2nd level_  \nYou gain the ability to temporarily enhance a weapon or armor. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one unenhanced object that is a suit of armor, a shield, or a simple or martial weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes an enhanced item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it’s armor or a shield or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it’s a weapon.\n\nOnce you’ve used this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.\n\nThis bonus increases to +2 at 10th level and +3 at 15th level.\n\n### Tool Expertise\n\n_**Engineer:** 2nd level_  \nYou gain expertise in any tool proficiencies you gain from this class.\n\n### Engineering Discipline\n\n_**Engineer:** 3rd, 6th, 14th, and 18th level_  \nYou begin to focus on a specific engineering discipline, which is detailed at the end of the class description.\n\n### Ability Score Improvement\n\n_**Engineer:** 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level_  \nYou can increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores by 1. You can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\n\n### Tech Mastery\n\n_**Engineer:** 20th level_  \nYour mastery of technology is unrivaled. Your Constitution and Intelligence scores increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2.\n\nAdditionally, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Potent Aptitude left, you regain one use.","n":0.024}}},{"i":54,"$":{"0":{"v":"Backgrounds","n":1},"1":{"v":"# Chapter 4: Personality and Backgrounds\n\nCharacters are defined by much more than their species and class. They’re individuals with their own stories, interests, connections, and capabilities beyond those that class and species define. This section expounds on the details that distinguish characters from one another, including the basics of name and physical description, the rules of backgrounds and languages, and the finer points of personality and alignment.\n\n## [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#character-details)Character Details\n\nYour character’s name and physical description might be the first things that the other players at the table learn about you. It’s worth thinking about how these characteristics reflect the character you have in mind.\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#name)Name\n\nYour character’s species description includes sample names for members of that species. Put some thought into your name even if you’re just picking one from a list.\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#sex)Sex\n\nYou can play a male or female character without gaining any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how your character does or does not conform to the broader culture’s expectations of sex, gender, and sexual behavior.\n\nYou don’t need to be confined to binary notions of sex and gender. Some species believe in companionship that doesn’t take into account gender. You could also play a female character who presents herself as a man or a man who feels trapped in a female body. Likewise, your character’s sexual orientation is for you to decide.\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#height-and-weight)Height and Weight\n\nYou can decide your character’s height and weight, using the information provided in your species description. Think about what your character’s ability scores might say about his or her height and weight. A weak but agile character might be thin. A strong and Durable character might be tall or heavy.\n\nYou can also roll randomly for your character’s height and weight using that species’s Physical Characteristics table, as shown above. The first dice roll given in the second column determines the character’s extra height (in inches) beyond the base height. That same number multiplied by the second dice roll or quantity given in the second column determines the character’s extra weight (in pounds) beyond the base weight.\n\nFor example, as a human, Obi-Wan has a height of 4 feet 8 inches plus 2d10 inches. We roll 2d10 and gets a total of 12, so Obi-Wan stands 5 feet 8 inches tall. Then we use that same roll of 12 and multiplies it by 2d4 pounds. His 2d4 roll is 3, so Obi-Wan weighs an extra 36 pounds (12x3) on top of his base 110 pounds, for a total of 146 pounds.\n\n___\n\n> ## [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#human)Human\n> \n> ___\n> \n> #### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#physical-characteristics)Physical Characteristics\n> \n> |  |  |  |  |\n> | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n> | **_Height_** |  | 4’8\" | +2d10\" |\n> | **_Weight_** |  | 110 lb. | x(2d4) lb. |\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#other-physical-characteristics)Other Physical Characteristics\n\nYou choose your character’s age and the color of his or her hair, eyes, and skin.

Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality, and is typically defined in terms of the Force: (light, dark, or balanced), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.\n\nThese brief summaries describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.\n\nYou can pick your alignment or roll to determine it randomly. Roll separately for Morality and Society.\n\n| d6 | Morality |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1-2 | **Light:** Usually the needs of others outweigh my own, (…) |\n| 3-4 | **Dark:** Usually my needs outweigh others’, (…) |\n| 5-6 | **Balanced:** Usually circumstances dictate whose needs are more important, (…) |\n\n| d6 | Society |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1-2 | **Lawful:** (…) but the means are as important as the end. |\n| 3-4 | **Chaotic:** (…) but the ends justify the means. |\n| 5-6 | **Neutral:** (…) but either the ends or the means may be more important, depending. |\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#alignment-in-the-galaxy)Alignment in the Galaxy\n\nFor many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans and ugnaughts can choose whether to follow the paths of darkness or light, of law or chaos. Lanniks tend to follow the light side, while sith purebloods tend toward the dark. Chiss are lawful, while aqualish are often chaotic.\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#languages)Languages\n\nYour species indicates the languages your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional languages of your choice. Note these languages on your character sheet.\n\nChoose your languages based on the species you commonly interact with. If you have a wookiee sidekick, you might understand-if not speak-Shyriiwook.

Four categories of characteristics are presented here: personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about your character’s favorite words or phrases, tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you can imagine.\n\nEach background presented later in this chapter includes suggested characteristics that you can use to spark your imagination. You’re not bound to those options, but they’re a good starting point.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#personality-traits)Personality Traits\n\nGive your character two personality traits. Personality traits are small, simple ways to help you set your character apart from every other character. Your personality traits should tell you something interesting and fun about your character. They should be self-descriptions that are specific about what makes your character stand out. “I’m smart” is not a good trait, because it describes a lot of characters. “I’ve read every book I can get my hands on” tells you something specific about your character’s interests and disposition.\n\nPersonality traits might describe the things your character likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your character dislikes or fears, your character’s self-attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of his or her ability scores.\n\nA useful place to start thinking about personality traits is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores and define one trait related to each. Either one could be positive or negative: you might work hard to overcome a low score, for example, or be cocky about your high score.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#ideals)Ideals\n\nDescribe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals are the things that you believe in most strongly, the fundamental moral and ethical principles that compel you to act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life goals to your core belief system.\n\nIdeals might answer any of these questions: What are the principles that you will never betray? What would prompt you to make sacrifices? What drives you to act and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single most important thing you strive for?\n\nYou can choose any ideals you like, but your character’s alignment is a good place to start defining them. Each background in this chapter includes six suggested ideals. Five of them are linked to aspects of alignment: dark, light, or neutral. The last one has more to do with the particular background than with moral or ethical perspectives.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#bonds)Bonds\n\nCreate one bond for your character. Bonds represent a character’s connections to people, places, and events in the world. They tie you to things from your background. They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead you to act against your own best interests if they are threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving a character’s motivations and goals.\n\nBonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do you care most about? To what place do you feel a special connection? What is your most treasured possession?\n\nYour bonds might be tied to your class, your background, your species, or some other aspect of your character’s history or personality. You might also gain new bonds over the course of your adventures.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#flaws)Flaws\n\nFinally, choose a flaw for your character. Your character’s flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness-in particular, anything that someone else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against your best interests. More significant than negative personality traits, a flaw might answer any of these questions: What enrages you? What’s the one person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What are your vices?\n\n## [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#inspiration)Inspiration\n\nInspiration is a rule the game master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that’s true to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By using inspiration, you can draw on your personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you call on your bond to the defense of your home village to push past the effect of a power that has been laid on you.\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#gaining-inspiration)Gaining Inspiration\n\nYour GM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, GMs award it when you play out your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your character in a compelling way. Your GM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the game.\n\nYou either have inspiration or you don’t - you can’t stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#using-inspiration)Using Inspiration\n\nIf you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll.\n\nAdditionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.\n\n## [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#backgrounds)Backgrounds\n\nEvery story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a pit fighter or a grizzled soldier. Your consular could have been a student or an envoy. Your operative might have gotten by as a government agent or commanded audiences as an entertainer.\n\nChoosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character’s identity. The most important question to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don’t you have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?\n\nThe sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#proficiencies)Proficiencies\n\nEach background gives a character proficiency in two skills. Skills are described in chapter 7.\n\nIn addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools. Tools and tool proficiencies are detailed in chapter 5.\n\nIf a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#languages-2)Languages\n\nSome backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by species. See “Languages” earlier in this chapter.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#equipment)Equipment\n\nEach background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the optional rule from chapter 5 to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#background-feat)Background Feat\n\nEach background gives a character a starting feat. Feats are described in chapter 6.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#suggested-characteristics)Suggested Characteristics\n\nA background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation.\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#customizing-a-background)Customizing a Background\n\nYou might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, a total of two tool proficiencies or languages, and a feat from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in chapter 5. (If you spend credits, you can’t also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your GM to create one.","n":0.021}}},{"i":55,"$":{"0":{"v":"Armormech Engineering","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\nThose engineers who choose the Armormech Engineering discipline focus on the ability to work with hard metals and electronic shielding to construct and enhance all types of personal armor.\n\n### Bonus Proficiencies\n\n_**Armormech Engineering:** 3rd level_\nYou gain proficiency in armormech’s implements, medium armor, and heavy armor.

This attack can target a surface, object, or creature.\n\nA creature struck by this attack is impaled by the harpoon. As an action, a creature can attempt to remove the harpoon. Removing the harpoon requires a Strength check. While the harpoon is stuck in the target, you are connected to the target by a 60 foot cable.\n\nWhile the harpoon is deployed, you can use your bonus action to activate the reel, pulling yourself to the location if the target is larger than you. A creature or object your size or smaller is pulled to you. Alternatively, you can opt to release the cable (no action required).\n\nOnce you’ve used this feature, you can’t use it again until you recover and reinsert the harpoon as an action.\n\n#### Heavy Suit\n\n_**Prerequisite:** 5th level, Armor_\nYou enhance your suit, making it difficult to move. As a bonus action, you can anchor or deanchor your feet to the ground. While anchored, your speed is 0, you have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift doubles. If it would already double, it instead triples.\n\n#### Infiltration Suit\n\n_**Prerequisite:** Armor_\nYou install a cloaking device in your modified armor. This device has 2 charges. As an action you can use 1 charge to cast _infiltrate_ targeting yourself.\n\nThe cloaking device regains all expended charges after a long rest.\n\n#### Magnetized Shield\n\n_**Prerequisite:** Physical Shield_\nYou modify your physical shield such that when a melee weapon attack misses you by an amount less than or equal to your bonus to AC from your shield, the attacking creature must make a Strength check against your tech save DC. On a failed save, the creature’s weapon adheres to the shield. As an action, a creature can repeat this check. On a success, the weapon is freed.\n\n#### Overload Shield\n\n_**Prerequisite:** Shield Generator_\nYou modify your shield generator to overload. As an action you can overload your shield. Each Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of you must make a Dexterity or Strength saving throw (their choice) against your tech save DC. On a failed save, they are pushed back 5 feet and knocked prone.\n\nYou can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n#### Power Fist\n\n_**Prerequisite:** Armor_\nYou modify your modified armor gauntlet with increased reinforcement and weight. Your modified armor’s unarmed strike deals 1d4 kinetic damage.\n\nAdditionally, when you take the Attack action and make an unarmed strike, you can make an additional unarmed strike as a bonus action.\n\n#### Prototype Power Fist\n\n_**Prerequisite:** 5th level, Power Fist_\nYou further modify your modified armor gauntlet with increased reinforcement and weight.

While integrated, that weapon gains the hidden property. Additionally, you have advantage on Strength saving throws to avoid being disarmed.\n","n":0.022}}},{"i":56,"$":{"0":{"v":"Venture","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n\nsource: https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#ventures\n\n## [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#chapter-6-customization-options)Chapter 6: Customization Options\n\nThe combination of your character’s personal features, as well as their chosen deployment, defines your character’s capabilities in the space component of the game, and the personal details you create set your character apart from every other character. Even within your class, species, and deployment specialization you have options to fine-tune what your character can do. But this chapter is for players who want to go a step further.\n\nThis chapter defines two sets of rules for customizing your character: multispeccing and ventures. Multispeccing lets you combine deployments together, and ventures are special options you can choose as you gain ranks.\n\nShips are locked to their respective size-driven tiers and have no multiclass parallels.\n\n## [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#multispecializing)Multispecializing\n\nMultispecializing allows you to gain ranks in multiple deployment specializations. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those deployments to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard specialization options.\n\nWith this rule, you have the option of gaining a rank in a new specialization whenever you advance in rank, instead of gaining a rank in your current specialization. Your ranks in all your deployments are added together to determine your character rank. For example, if you have two ranks in pilot and one in gunner, you’re a 3rd-rank character.\n\nAs you advance in ranks, you might primarily remain a member of your original deployment with just a single rank in another specialization, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the deployment you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth specialization. Compared to a single-specialized character of the same rank, you’ll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.\n\n> #### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#multispecializing-example)Multispecializing Example\n>\n> Drew is playing a 1st-rank pilot. When his character is ready to progress to 2nd rank, Drew decides that his character will multispec instead of continuing to progress as a pilot. Drew’s character has been spending a lot of time with Rickey’s gunner, and has even been doing some simulations. Drew decides that his character will multispec into the gunner deployment, and thus his character becomes a 1st-rank pilot and 1st-rank gunner (written as pilot 1/gunner 1).\n> When Drew’s character is ready to progress to 3rd rank, he can decide whether to add another pilot rank (becoming a pilot 2/gunner 1), another gunner rank (becoming a pilot 1/gunner 2), or a rank in a third deployment, perhaps dabbling in the inner workings of the ship (becoming a pilot 1/gunner 1/mechanic 1).\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#prerequisites)Prerequisites\n\nUnlike classes, there are no requirements for multispeccing. When a player has progressed to a rank higher than 1, they can choose to multispec or focus on their primary deployment specialization, with no external requirements or considerations.\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#milestones)Milestones\n\nRather than traditional experience and book-keeping, ranks should be awarded as milestones for completing a specific encounter, or obtaining certain knowledge.\n\n### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#proficiency-bonus)Proficiency Bonus\n\nShips do not have a proficiency bonus. When a feature references a proficiency bonus, instead use the proficiency bonus of the appropriate crewmember as long as the crewmember has at least one deployment rank.\n\n> Rather than having a separate proficiency bonus for the space and ground portions of your game, your proficiency bonus for space is the same as that of the ground.\n\nIf a deployment feature or venture allows you to forgo your proficiency bonus, you may only do so once.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#expertise)Expertise\n\nIf you have expertise in a skill as well as a feature that lets you forgo your proficiency bonus, you can only forgo your proficiency bonus once. For instance, if you are a 5th-level, 4th-rank pilot with an 18 in Intelligence and expertise in Piloting, you add 10 to your Piloting checks (4 + 2 x 3). If you use the 4th-rank pilot feature “That’s a Good Trick” to forgo your proficiency bonus, you instead add 7 for the Piloting check as a part of that Evade action (4 + 2 x 3 - 3).\n\n## [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#gunning-styles)Gunning Styles\n\nCertain deployment features or ventures offer your choice of Gunning Style. Choose from the following. You can’t take a Gunning Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#cannoneer)Cannoneer\n\nYou are skilled with laser cannons. While you are firing a primary weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls and save DCs.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#heavy-gunner)Heavy Gunner\n\nYou are skilled with railguns and turbolasers. While you are firing a secondary weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and save DCs.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#payload-delivery)Payload Delivery\n\nYou are skilled with mines, missiles, rockets, and other explosive weapons. When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for a tertiary or quaternary weapon, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.\n\n## [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#gunning-masteries)Gunning Masteries\n\nCertain deployment features or ventures offer your choice of Gunning Mastery. Choose from the following. You can’t take a Gunning Mastery option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#cannon-mastery)Cannon Mastery\n\nYou are the master of laser cannons. While you are firing a primary weapon, when you take the Fire action, you can choose to fire rapidly at the expense of accuracy. Your attacks are made without the aid of your proficiency bonus, but you use your bonus action to make an additional attack, also without your proficiency bonus.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#heavy-gun-mastery)Heavy Gun Mastery\n\nYou are the master of railguns and turbolasers. While you are firing a secondary weapon, before you make an attack, you can choose to double your proficiency bonus. If the attack hits, you reduce the damage dealt by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus.\n\n#### [](https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/customization#payload-mastery)Payload Mastery\n\nYou are the master of missiles, rockets, and other ship-board explosive weapons. While you are firing a tertiary or quaternary weapon, you can choose to reduce the DC by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus. If you do, and the target fails the saving throw, they take additional damage equal to twice your proficiency bonus.\n\n## Ventures\n\nVentures represent talents beyond the deployment specialization of a character. This embodies their training and experience in other aspects of their lives. At certain deployment ranks, your deployment gives you the Venture feature. You can take each venture only once, unless the venture’s description says otherwise.\n\nYou must meet any prerequisite specified in a venture to take that venture. If you ever lose a venture’s prerequisite, you can’t use that venture again until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Spacecasting venture requires you to be able to cast force or tech powers. If your character loses the ability to do so, you can’t benefit from the Spacecasting venture until you regain the ability to cast force or tech powers.\n\n> Ventures, and this book in general, are designed and written in such a way that they have minimal impact on the ground game.
