aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#armormech-engineering\"></a>Armormech Engineering</h1>\n<p>Those engineers who choose the Armormech Engineering discipline focus on the ability to work with hard metals and electronic shielding to construct and enhance all types of personal armor.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bonus-proficiencies\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#bonus-proficiencies\"></a>Bonus Proficiencies</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Armormech Engineering:</strong> 3rd level</em>\nYou gain proficiency in armormech’s implements, medium armor, and heavy armor. Additionally, when you engage in crafting with armormech’s implements, the rate at which you craft doubles.</p>\n<h3 id=\"modified-armor\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#modified-armor\"></a>Modified Armor</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Armormech Engineering:</strong> 3rd level</em>\nYou learn to modify one unenhanced suit of armor or shield utilizing your armormech knowledge. Over the course of a long rest, you can modify one suit of armor or a shield. You must have the armor or shield and armormech’s implements in order to perform this modification.</p>\n<p>Your modified armor or shield is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your modified armor has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).</p>\n<p>Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you can maintain both a modified suit of armor and shield. Each modified item has modification slots as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table.</p>\n<h3 id=\"damage-absorption\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#damage-absorption\"></a>Damage Absorption</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Armormech Engineering:</strong> 3rd level</em>\nWhen you take damage, you can use your reaction and expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to absorb some of that damage. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by the amount rolled on the die + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1). You must be wearing your modified armor or wielding your modified shield to gain this benefit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"extra-attack\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#extra-attack\"></a>Extra Attack</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Armormech Engineering:</strong> 6th level</em>\nYou can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. You must be wearing your modified armor or wielding your modified shield to gain this benefit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"armormechs-celerity\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#armormechs-celerity\"></a>Armormech’s Celerity</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Armormech Engineering:</strong> 14th and 17th level</em>\nWhen you take the Attack action or use your action to a cast a tech power of 1st-level or higher, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature five times. You gain an additional use at 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>\n<h3 id=\"suit-reliability\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#suit-reliability\"></a>Suit Reliability</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Armormech Engineering:</strong> 18th level</em>\nYour suit is like a second skin. Whenever you make an ability check or saving throw that uses Strength, Dexterity,or Constitution, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10. You must be wearing your modified armor or wielding your modified shield to gain this benefit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"armormech-modifications\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#armormech-modifications\"></a>Armormech Modifications</h3>\n<p>If a modification has prerequisites, you must meet them to install it.
