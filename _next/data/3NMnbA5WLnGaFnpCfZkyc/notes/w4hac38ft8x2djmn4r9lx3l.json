All ten classes receive their archetype at 3rd level, instead of it varying by class. Additionally, all classes have a second level of customization beyond archetype, similar to how Warlocks get Invocations in 5e. Lastly, all class capstones now offer a total of +4 to ability scores, including their maximums.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Berserker:</strong> This is an adaptation of the barbarian class, with the additional customization layer of Berserker Instincts. Berserker capstone ability scores reduced, but they gain an additional feature.</li>\n<li><strong>Consular:</strong> The full caster for the Force side of casting, this class consolidates features of cleric, sorcerer, and wizard. It has Force-Empowered Casting as its second layer of customization, which is derived from sorcerer’s Metamagic.</li>\n<li><strong>Engineer:</strong> The engineer is a full caster for the tech side of casting, extrapolating from artificer with some bard elements sprinkled in. The additional layer of customization for engineers is driven from its archetypes.</li>\n<li><strong>Fighter:</strong> Similar to it’s 5e counterpart, with two major changes: maneuvers are now a baseline feature, and fighters gain strategies are their second level of customization.</li>\n<li><strong>Guardian:</strong> Mostly derived from paladin, guardians are the half caster for the Force. Their second level of customization is their auras.</li>\n<li><strong>Monk:</strong> Monks are naturally inspired by their 5e counterpart, but with a significant number of changes and buffs. They gain a second level of customization in their Monastic Vows.</li>\n<li><strong>Operative:</strong> This version of the rogue has operative exploits as their second level of customization. Additionally, most archetypes grant alternative ways to use Sneak Attack.</li>\n<li><strong>Scholar:</strong> This brand new class has two levels of customization beyond archetypes: maneuvers (similar to that of the fighter class) and discoveries.</li>\n<li><strong>Scout:</strong> This is the half caster for the tech side of casting, naturally inspired by the ranger, with baseline hunter’s mark and a second level of customization called Scout Routines.</li>\n<li><strong>Sentinel:</strong> This Force caster utilizes a new “two-thirds” casting progression, falling between guardian and consular. It utilizes some bard features, and has an additional layer of customization called Sentinel Ideals.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"chapter-4-backgrounds\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#chapter-4-backgrounds\"></a><a href=\"https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#chapter-4-backgrounds\"></a>Chapter 4: Backgrounds</h4>\n<p>Backgrounds feature one major difference; each background also offers a choice of feat. This helps players realize their characters in a more personal fashion.</p>\n<h4 id=\"chapter-5-equipment\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#chapter-5-equipment\"></a><a href=\"https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#chapter-5-equipment\"></a>Chapter 5: Equipment</h4>\n<p>Currency has been changed to credits, with roughly 1 gp = 10 cr. Magic items are reskinned as enhanced items, with rarities designed to mimic those of <strong>Star Wars: the Old Republic</strong>. Equipment functions similarly, with the exception of the breakdown of weapons; rather than just simple and martial, they are broken down into blasters, lightsabers, and vibroweapons. This also includes three tiers of shields: light, medium, and heavy, with proficiencies collapsed into the appropriate armor. There is a significant number of new weapon properties as well, and most items are new otherwise.</p>\n<h4 id=\"chapter-6-customization-options\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#chapter-6-customization-options\"></a><a href=\"https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#chapter-6-customization-options\"></a>Chapter 6: Customization Options</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New multiclassing requirements/proficiencies</li>\n<li>Spell point variant with different multiclassing</li>\n<li>Fighting styles have been completely changed, with paired fighting masteries</li>\n<li>Lots more feats</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"chapter-7-using-ability-scores\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#chapter-7-using-ability-scores\"></a><a href=\"https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#chapter-7-using-ability-scores\"></a>Chapter 7: Using Ability Scores</h4>\n<p>Generally the same, with the exception of skills; Arcana, History, and Religion have been collapsed into Lore, with Piloting and Technology being new skills. Expertise is now a defined keyword alongside proficiency.</p>\n<h4 id=\"chapter-8-adventuring\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#chapter-8-adventuring\"></a><a href=\"https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#chapter-8-adventuring\"></a>Chapter 8: Adventuring</h4>\n<p>Minor changes to better fit the galaxy at large.</p>\n<h4 id=\"chapter-9-combat\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#chapter-9-combat\"></a><a href=\"https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#chapter-9-combat\"></a>Chapter 9: Combat</h4>\n<p>Lots of changes here. This chapter will want to be read start to finish, despite it being similar to traditional 5e.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Object Interaction is now more specifically defined and utilized.</li>\n<li>New action: Guard.</li>\n<li>Shoving split in to two separate keywords so they can be cited independently.</li>\n<li>Double-Weapon Fighting is a new mechanic for weapons with two ends for fighting.</li>\n<li>Two-Weapon Fighting now works with blasters.</li>\n<li>Three layers of partial cover, instead of only two, with adjusted values.</li>\n<li>Critical Hit Range a defined attribute.</li>\n<li>Damage types have been changed.</li>\n<li>Rules for temporary force and tech points, which function similar to temporary hit points.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"chapter-10-force--and-tech-casting\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#chapter-10-force--and-tech-casting\"></a><a href=\"https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#chapter-10-force-and-tech-casting\"></a>Chapter 10: Force- and Tech-casting</h4>\n<p>There are several changes in this section:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spells are now called powers.</li>\n<li>Cantrips are now called at-will powers.</li>\n<li>There are no more class lists. Instead, your force- or tech-casting feature gives you access to the full force or tech powers list.</li>\n<li>A simplification of the spell point variant from the DMG. Basically, casting a power at a given level costs that level + 1 points.</li>\n<li>Spellcasting has been separated into force- and tech-casting. Forcecasting uses Wisdom/Charisma and Force Points, which regenerate on a long rest. Techcasting uses Intelligence and Tech Points, which regenerate on a short or long rest. While a character can have both force- and tech-casting, they are kept completely separate.</li>\n<li>The number of known at-will powers and 1st-level and higher powers are no longer separate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"chapters-11-and-12-force-and-tech-powers\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#chapters-11-and-12-force-and-tech-powers\"></a><a href=\"https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#chapters-11-and-12-force-and-tech-powers\"></a>Chapters 11 and 12: Force and Tech Powers</h4>\n<p>Chapter 11 has been broken down into two chapters to keep force and tech powers separate.</p>\n<h4 id=\"chapter-13-maneuvers\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#chapter-13-maneuvers\"></a><a href=\"https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#chapter-13-maneuvers\"></a>Chapter 13: Maneuvers</h4>\n<p>Unlike 5e, Maneuvers are a single pool of options similar to spells that any class or archetype with superiority can select from.</p>\n<h4 id=\"appendix-a-conditions\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#appendix-a-conditions\"></a><a href=\"https://sw5e.com/rules/phb#appendix-a-conditions\"></a>Appendix A: Conditions</h4>\n<p>This appendix features most (all?) of the traditional 5e conditions, as well as a couple new ones.</p>\n<h4 id=\"appendix-b-recommended-variant-rules\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#appendix-b-recommended-variant-rules\"></a><a
