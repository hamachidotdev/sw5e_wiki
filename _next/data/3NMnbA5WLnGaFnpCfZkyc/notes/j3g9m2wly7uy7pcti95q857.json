Before jumping to hyperspace, a ship must plot a course via astrogation by completing 10 astrogation equations. When not under stress, a crewmember can take 10 minutes to carefully make these calculations and check them, resulting in automatic success. When under duress, such as in combat situations, a crewmember can calculate astronavigation with an Intelligence (Astrogation) check as an action on their turn, and then consults the <strong>Astrogation Results</strong> table.</p>\n<h4 id=\"astrogation-results\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#astrogation-results\"></a><a href=\"https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/adventuring#astrogation-results\"></a>Astrogation Results</h4>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<table><thead><tr><th>d20</th><th>Result</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>9 or lower</td><td>Your calculations fail, resulting in no completed equations.</td></tr><tr><td>10-15</td><td>Your calculations are adequate, resulting in one completed equation.</td></tr><tr><td>16-20</td><td>Your calculations include a breakthrough, resulting in two completed equations.</td></tr><tr><td>21-25</td><td>Your calculations are excellent, resulting in three completed equations.</td></tr><tr><td>26-29</td><td>Your calculations are masterful, resulting in four completed equations.</td></tr><tr><td>30+</td><td>Your calculations are perfect, resulting in five completed equations.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Additionally, the accuracy of the check is affected by how old the astrogation information is. If the astrogation information is less than a day old, the operator has advantage on the check. If the information is older than a week, however, they have disadvantage on the check.</p>\n<p>You may choose to penalize your Intelligence (Astrogation) checks by 5 before making them in order to reduce your travel time by 24 hours; if this would reduce the travel time to less than 24 hours, you instead reduce the remaining travel time by one-half, to a minimum of 1 hour. You must restart your calculations if you change this course choice.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you may gain a +5 circumstance bonus on your Intelligence (Astrogation) checks if you voluntarily double the travel time.</p>\n<h4 id=\"hyperspace-hazards\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#hyperspace-hazards\"></a><a href=\"https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/adventuring#hyperspace-hazards\"></a>Hyperspace Hazards</h4>\n<p>A jump to hyperspace can always be rushed, being made before all ten equations are completed, but such travel can be incredibly dangerous. If a starship is disabled because of a poorly plotted hyperspace course, the GM usually chooses the point at which the ship drops out of hyperspace at random. GMs looking for a more in-depth description of a hyperspace mishap can consult the table below. For every complete equation, add 1 to your roll on the table below. If you roll a 1 on your die, you roll again on the table in addition to suffering the indicated penalty. If you make a jump without <em>any</em> calculations and roll a 20, your ship comes out of hyperspace unscathed, but in a completely unknown location.</p>\n<h4 id=\"detecting-hyperspace-travel\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#detecting-hyperspace-travel\"></a><a href=\"https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/adventuring#detecting-hyperspace-travel\"></a>Detecting Hyperspace Travel</h4>\n<p>When a starship enters or exits hyperspace, it generates a short burst of Cronau radiation. Any facility with adequate sensor arrays can detect this radiation burst with a DC 20 Wisdom (Scan) check. Success would indicate that a ship entered or exited the system as well as the point of arrival or departure. With a successful Intelligence (Probe) check (DC 25), the angle of departure can be determined, indicating possible destinations.</p>\n<h4 id=\"hyperspace-mishaps\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#hyperspace-mishaps\"></a><a href=\"https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/adventuring#hyperspace-mishaps\"></a>Hyperspace Mishaps</h4>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<table><thead><tr><th>D20</th><th>Result</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>20+</td><td>The ship suffers no adverse consequences.</td></tr><tr><td>18-19</td><td>The ship encounters dumped cargo, setting off a collision alarm.

Each time a ship docks in a major spaceport, they can update their astrogation data for a 150 credit fee. Astrogation data is routinely updated and is rarely more than a week old.</p>\n</blockquote>","noteIndex":{"id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","title":"Home","desc":"","updated":1677092773137,"created":1631901573363,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"9fe5ffe8639f4d3130538888ddbfc029","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"sessions","alias":"sessions","position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":3,"offset":228},"end":{"line":12,"column":18,"offset":243},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"sessions"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"characters","alias":"characters","position":{"start":{"line":13,"column":3,"offset":246},"end":{"line":13,"column":20,"offset":263},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"characters"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"world","alias":"world","position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":3,"offset":266},"end":{"line":14,"column":15,"offset":278},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"world"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"world.places","alias":"world.places","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":5,"offset":283},"end":{"line":15,"column":24,"offset":302},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"world.places"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"world.factions","alias":"world.factions","position":{"start":{"line":16,"column":5,"offset":307},"end":{"line":16,"column":26,"offset":328},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"world.factions"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"world.objects","alias":"world.objects","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":5,"offset":333},"end":{"line":17,"column":25,"offset":353},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"world.objects"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"world.ships","alias":"world.ships","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":5,"offset":358},"end":{"line":18,"column":23,"offset":376},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"world.ships"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"world.species","alias":"world.species","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":5,"offset":381},"end":{"line":19,"column":25,"offset":401},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"world.species"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"game-references","alias":"game-references","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":3,"offset":404},"end":{"line":20,"column":25,"offset":426},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"game-references"}}],"anchors":{"welcome-to-the-sw5e-wiki":{"type":"header","text":"Welcome to the SW5E Wiki","value":"welcome-to-the-sw5e-wiki","line":10,"column":0,"depth":2},"contents":{"type":"header","text":"Contents","value":"contents","line":16,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["a6lywyt55ekyo90nxi6sowf","67nq8r06mptwrwq2iawcqzs","q47io53e2mozudh6em7birq","wgv3ma9aji1ktnezcty7ibh"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n![](/assets/images/2023-01-08-13-43-38.png)\n\n## Welcome to the SW5E Wiki\n\n- [Home](https://newman174.github.io/sw5e_wiki/)\n- [Github](https://github.com/newman174/sw5e_wiki)\n- [Official Site](https://sw5e.com/)\n\n## Contents\n\n- [[sessions.md]]\n- [[characters.md]]\n- [[world.md]]\n  -
