<p>BT-1 accompanied Aphra and Vader, together with 0-0-0, for their mission on <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Geonosis" title="Geonosis">Geonosis</a>, where Aphra had heard of a Geonosian queen who was in control of a droid factory. The four invaded the queen's factory, stole the machine that constructed droids and quickly escaped. Not much later, a <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bounty_hunter" title="Bounty hunter">bounty hunter</a> that Darth Vader had earlier hired, <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Krrsantan" title="Krrsantan">Krrsantan</a> arrived, with <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cylo" title="Cylo">Cylo-IV</a>, a person who Vader was suspicious of. Vader ordered 0-0-0 to interrogate Cylo-IV and when 0-0-0 believed that he had extracted all information he could, he killed him. 0-0-0 told Vader that Cylo-IV was training <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Sidious" title="Darth Sidious">the Emperor's</a> possible future replacements for Vader and the Dark Lord set course for <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cylo%27s_research_base" title="Cylo&#x27;s research base">Cylo-IV's research base</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-DV4_6-1"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-DV4-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>To start off his attack, Vader sent BT-1 and 0-0-0 into the base as distractions. He then proceeded to attack Cylo-IV's men from behind, with his small army of droids. As he continued into the base, Vader found two twin humans, one <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Gender" title="Gender">male</a> and one female. The twins attacked him, using <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber" title="Lightsaber">lightsabers</a>, however it was clear to Vader that they weren't <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Force-sensitive" title="Force-sensitive">Force-sensitive</a>. After a quick fight, the two humans were told to stop by Cylo-IV, who revealed that he was an immortal system that switched to a new body as soon as the previous was destroyed and that his current body was called Cylo-V.<sup id="cite_ref-Vader_5_5-1"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-Vader_5-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Cylo-V introduced his replacements for Vader and as Vader was about to strike Cylo down, the Emperor revealed himself to be in their presence and asked to see what Cylo's replacements were capable of.<sup id="cite_ref-Vader_5_5-2"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-Vader_5-5">[5]</a></sup> Cylo started by showing off the twins from before, named <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Aiolin_Astarte" title="Aiolin Astarte">Aiolin</a> and <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Morit_Astarte" title="Morit Astarte">Morit Astarte</a>. He continued to show the rest of his warriors, until he decided to show their abilities by having them all fight each other to the death.

Sidious stopped the fighting, wanting to use them against his own enemies instead of each other. Vader left Cylo's research station and waited for <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Boba_Fett" title="Boba Fett">Boba Fett</a>, the bounty hunter he had hired to find the person responsible for destroying the <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/DS-1_Death_Star_Mobile_Battle_Station" title="DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station">Death Star</a>.

<p>Sometime later, Vader instructed Aphra to join up with a group of bounty hunters and plunder an Imperial ship for credits. After sharing the credits between each other, the bounty hunters parted ways.<sup id="cite_ref-DV8_10-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-DV8-10">[10]</a></sup> Vader then sent Aphra to retrieve information on <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Commodex_Tahn" title="Commodex Tahn">Commodex Tahn</a>, the person who buried <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala" title="Padmé Amidala">Padmé Amidala</a>, as Vader wanted to confirm that Padmé gave birth to Vader's son before dying.

<p>0-0-0 and BT-1 lose a game of holochess</p>
<p>Aphra, 0-0-0 and BT-1 soon returned to the Ante, seeking information on Luke Skywalker's location, while BT-1 and 0-0-0 went to play <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dejarik" title="Dejarik">holochess</a>. The Ante quickly figured out that Aphra was one of the plunderers of the Imperial ship carrying credits, after seeing the amount of credits she was ready to give, but still gave the location of Luke. The Spire was soon attacked by Imperials who believed that one of the plunderers were there. After quickly interrogating the Ante, the Imperials learned that Aphra was one of the plunderers from before. Aphra, BT-1 and 0-0-0 escaped the Spire, before finding themselves locked in by an Imperial blockade.<sup id="cite_ref-DV11_13-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-DV11-13">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Darth Vader, who was on one of the blockade ship and could not reveal that he was working with Aphra, was able to convince <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Inspector" title="Inspector">Inspector</a> <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Thanoth" title="Thanoth">Thanoth</a> that they were wasting their time chasing a thief, when they could instead attack the recently discovered base of a <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Alliance_to_Restore_the_Republic" title="Alliance to Restore the Republic">Rebel Alliance</a> squadron. With the blockade gone, Aphra met up with Vader again and told him that Luke was located on <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vrogas_Vas" title="Vrogas Vas">Vrogas Vas</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-DV12_14-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-DV12-14">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Before finding Luke, Vader took BT-1 and 0-0-0 with him to ore-rich planet of <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Shu-Torun" title="Shu-Torun">Shu-Torun</a>, where both the <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ore-duke" title="Ore-duke">ore-dukes</a> and the ruling family were slowly rebelling against the Imperial control. While Vader was taken to a celebration party with <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Prince" title="Prince">Princess</a> <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Trios" title="Trios">Trios</a>, the two droids went to assassinate the king and his servants. When Vader and Trios found the dead bodies, Vader informed Trios that from now on, she would become the Queen of Shu-Torun and warned her that if the planet kept resisting the Empire, consequences would follow.<sup id="cite_ref-DVA1_15-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-DVA1-15">[15]</a></sup> Vader then sent BT-1 and 0-0-0 back to Aphra, while he set course for Vrogas Vas.<sup id="cite_ref-VD1_16-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-VD1-16">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Vader kept contact with Aphra as he arrived above the planet, but not soon after arriving, he was attacked by Rebel Alliance ships. Aphra listened as Vader's ship crashed and decided to go and save Vader, with 0-0-0 and BT-1.<sup id="cite_ref-VD1_16-1"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-VD1-16">[16]</a></sup> After landing on the planet, they found Luke Skywalker and his astromech droid <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/R2-D2" title="R2-D2">R2-D2</a>. In order to trick Luke, Aphra painted 0-0-0 <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Color" title="Color">yellow</a> and tricked Luke into believing that he was <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/C-3PO" title="C-3PO">C-3PO</a>, one of Luke's allies. 0-0-0 was able to get near Luke and shock him with electricity, making him fall unconscious.<sup id="cite_ref-DV13_17-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-DV13-17">[17]</a></sup> When he saw that he stood no chance against BT-1, R2 ran away, with BT-1 not far behind, following him.<sup id="cite_ref-SW13_18-0"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-SW13-18">[18]</a></sup></p>

A fight between the four broke out, while Luke was still unconscious. R2 soon found Luke again, who was now conscious and the two outran BT-1. BT-1 then regrouped with 0-0-0, who had lost both his arms, one pulled off by Chewbacca, one by Luke and found that Aphra had fallen unconscious in the fight against Han.<sup id="cite_ref-SW13_18-1"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-SW13-18">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>The two droids got ready to eradicate Luke, Chewbacca, Han, and R2, but as BT-1 got his weapons ready, R2 sprayed oil on him, blinding BT and resulting in him shooting everywhere, giving time for the others to escape and trapping the two droids under rubble.<sup id="cite_ref-SW13_18-2"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/BT-1#cite_note-SW13-18">[18]</a></sup> As soon as Aphra woke up, she helped the droids out of the rubble and ordered the droids to find and secretly follow Luke.

<p>When 0-0-0 and BT found Luke, they saw that he was fighting Imperial troops and deduced that Vader was not near, as the Sith Lord was operating alone.

Luke was found again by Han, Chewbacca, R2, and 3PO, before the group was approached by Aphra, who informed the group that they were standing on a minefield and threatened to kill them all if they didn't allow themselves to be captured. As they began dropping their weapons, <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Leia_Skywalker_Organa_Solo" title="Leia Skywalker Organa Solo">Leia</a> knocked Aphra unconscious from behind.

<p>After getting the necessary data to locate the Citadel, the crew started to flee the Temple. However, they ran into a group of stormtroopers.

When they were sighted by another group of Imperials, Chelli ordered the rest to run while she held them off. 0-0-0 complained he was too slow, so BT-1 extended some footrests and handles so that the protocol droid could ride him for a faster escape. The group managed to make it to a ledge on the outside of the Temple, but found themselves surrounded. Before they could be captured or executed, the <em>Ark Angel II</em> appeared, and BT-1 provided a smokescreen so they could safely board the ship and escape. Once they reached the Citadel, BT-1 disembarked with the rest of the crew to explore the structure.
