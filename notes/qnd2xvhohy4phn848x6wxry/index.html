<p>Your first step in transitioning to the space portion of your <em>Star Wars</em> 5th Edition campaign is imagining how having a starship impacts your character. When participating in the space portion of the game, your character is impacted by a number of features, including their chosen deployment, the size and style of ship on which they adventure, and the modification and equipment that ship has access to. These choices can enhance and enrich your avatar.</p>
<p>Before you dive into step 1 below, think about where your adventurer would be most likely to participate in a starship. You might be a dauntless pilot, or a crushing gunner. Perhaps you are a genius mechanic, an intricate operator, or a charming pilot. Maybe you are interested in a mixture of these roles.</p>
<p>Additionally, what kind of ship, and your intended purpose, can impact these decisions. Do you want to be a soldier in the Imperial Navy, piloting a TIE fighter and leading a squadron? Or are you more inclined to travel as a mercenary aboard a light freighter, taking jobs as you see fit in order to keep your ship in space? Maybe you instead want to be a bounty hunter in an assault craft, tracking your quarry to the Outer Rim, and beyond?</p>
<p>Once you have an idea in mind, follow these steps in order, making decisions that reflect the character and ship you want. Your conception of your character and starship might evolve with each choice you make. What’s important is that you come to the table with a character you’re excited to play.</p>
<p>Throughout this section, we use the term <strong>deployment sheet</strong> and <strong>starship sheet</strong> to mean whatever you use to track your character, whether it’s a formal sheet (like the ones at the end of these rules), some form of digital record, or a piece of notebook paper. The official SW5e sheets are a fine place to start until you know what information you need and how you use it during the game.</p>

<p>Each step of ship/crew creation includes an example of that step, with a player building the iconic starship the Millennium Falcon, as it is portrayed during the events of Episode IV.</p>

<p>A crew is nothing without its starship, and this chapter covers the acquisition and initial set up of starships. Like classes and deployments, starships have their own features that are driven by their size category. The <strong>Starships</strong> chapter provides more information about acquiring a starship, <a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#Starship%20Size%20Categories">Starship Size Categories</a>, and starship features.</p>
<p>What starship you acquire is the second impactful decision you make when you adopt the space portion of your campaign. Each size category of starship has unique and tangible features, and determines what kind of crew your starship can support. A Small starship, for instance, can support 1-2 crew members at tier 0, while a Medium starship can support an entire adventuring party. At larger sizes, the crew shifts into the hundreds and thousands of crew members a ship can support.</p>
<h4 id="tier"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#tier"></a><a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#tier"></a>Tier</h4>
<p>Once you’ve obtained your starship - through any number of ways - you gain the ability to upgrade your ship. Typically, like deployments, starships are obtained at tier 0. A tier 0 ship is typically newly constructed, or otherwise not yet battle-tested or broken in.</p>
<p>Starting off at tier 0 marks the beginning of your starship’s journey and evolution. Over time, with the use of resources and workers - and credits - a starship can be upgraded from tier 0 all the way up to tier 5, unlocking unique features - and choices - as it improves.</p>
<h4 id="hull-points-and-hull-dice"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#hull-points-and-hull-dice"></a><a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#hull-points-and-hull-dice"></a>Hull Points and Hull Dice</h4>
<p>Your starship’s hull points define how tough your ship’s hull is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your hull points are determined by your Hull Dice (short for Hull Point Dice).</p>
<p>At tier 0, your starship has a varying quantity and size of Hull Dice, depending on its size category. Your starship starts with hull points equal to the highest roll of that die, as well as the average roll for each additional Hull Die. You also add your Constitution modifier to each die. This is your <strong>hull point maximum</strong>.</p>
<p>Record your starship’s hull points on your starship sheet. Also record the type of Hull Die your starship uses and the number of Hull Dice it has. After you conduct repairs - and at certain other points - you can spend Hull Dice to regain hull points (see “Repairs” in the Adventuring section).</p>
<h4 id="shield-points-and-shield-dice"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#shield-points-and-shield-dice"></a><a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#shield-points-and-shield-dice"></a>Shield Points and Shield Dice</h4>
<p>Most starships also have shields, although they do not come standard, and their strength - your ship’s <strong>shield point maximum</strong> - and the amount they can regenerate each round - your ship’s <strong>shield regeneration rate</strong> - is determined partially by your Shield Dice and partially by your choice of shields, detailed in the <strong>Equipment</strong> chapter. The number and type of shield dice normally parallels your Hull Dice.</p>

<h5 id="building-the-millennium-falcon-step-1"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#building-the-millennium-falcon-step-1"></a><a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#building-the-millennium-falcon-step-1"></a>Building the Millennium Falcon, Step 1</h5>
<p>The Millennium Falcon is a heavily modified YT-1300f light freighter, and falls under the Medium size category. The ship starts at tier 0.<br>
As a tier 0 Medium ship, the Millennium Falcon has 5 Hull Dice - which are d8s - and a Constitution modifier of +1. Consequently, the Millennium Falcon has 33 hull points: 8 + the average for the subsequent four dice (5) + the Constitution modifier for each Hull Die (5 x 1).<br>
When the Millennium Falcon progresses to tier 1 it gains the following features: Starship Improvements and Evasive Maneuvers. We record Evasive Maneuvers on the starship sheet. Since the Millennium Falcon is fast, we increase its Strength with the Ability Score Improvement. It gains an additional Hull Dice, and it’s current and maximum hull points increases by 6. It also gains additional modifications, discussed in Chapter 4.<br>
Additionally, at tier 0, a Medium ship gets a choice of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throws proficiencies. For the Falcon, we choose Strength.</p>

<h3 id="2-determine-ability-scores"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#2-determine-ability-scores"></a><a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#2-determine-ability-scores"></a>2. Determine Ability Scores</h3>
<p>Much of what your ship does in the game depends on its six abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each ability has a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.</p>
<p>The six abilities and their use in the game are described in the <strong>Using Ability Scores</strong> chapter. The Ability Score Summary table provides a quick reference for what qualities are measured by each ability. Ships size categories decrease and/or increase the base ability scores, as can tier advancements and ship modifications.</p>
<p>You generate your ship - s six ability scores using a standard array of ability scores that you assign to each ability as you wish (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma): 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. Afterward, make any changes to your ability scores as a result of your ship size.</p>
<p>After assigning your ability scores, determine your ability modifiers using the <a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#Ability%20Scores%20and%20Modifiers">Ability Scores and Modifiers</a> table. To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the result by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to each of your scores.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 id="building-the-millennium-falcon-step-2"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#building-the-millennium-falcon-step-2"></a><a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#building-the-millennium-falcon-step-2"></a>Building The Millennium Falcon, Step 2</h5>
<p>We will use the standard set of scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) for the Falcon - s abilities. The Falcon is fast nimble, so we - ll put it’s highest scores, 15 and 14, in Strength and Dexterity, respectively. We then apply the 13 to Intelligence, the 12 to Constitution, the 10 to Wisdom and the 8 to Charisma. Because Medium ships have no ability score adjustments, The Falcon’s <a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#Ability%20Scores%20and%20Modifiers">Ability Scores and Modifiers</a> look like this: Strength 15 (+2), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 12 (+1), Intelligence 13 (+1), Wisdom 10 (+0), Charisma 8 (-1).</p>

<h4 id="variant-customizing-ability-scores"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#variant-customizing-ability-scores"></a><a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#variant-customizing-ability-scores"></a>Variant: Customizing Ability Scores</h4>
<p>At your Game Master - s option, you can use this variant for determining your ship’s ability scores. The method described here allows you to build a ship with a set of ability scores you choose individually.</p>
<p>You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the <a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#Ability%20Score%20Point%20Cost">Ability Score Point Cost</a> table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with, before applying special increases. You can - t have a score lower than 8.</p>
<p>This method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set of three high numbers and three low ones (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are above average and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 12), or any set of numbers between those extremes.</p>

<p>Your starship includes a number of standard modifi-cations, and can include more modifications - at the expense of credits, workers, and time - enhancing and augmenting the ship’s functionality. Modifications fall into five categories: engineering, operation, suite, universal, and weapon. The <strong>Modifications</strong> chapter provides more information about these categories and installation costs.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 id="building-the-millennium-falcon-step-3"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#building-the-millennium-falcon-step-3"></a><a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#building-the-millennium-falcon-step-3"></a>Building the Millennium Falcon, Step 3</h5>
<p>At tier 0, the Millennium Falcon comes with one Barracks at no cost. Additionally, we choose a Living Quarters to give the crew their own rooms. We also choose the Recreation and Storage Compartment suites, bringing the total modifications to 3.<br>
The Millennium Falcon has dorsal and ventral cannons, so we choose two Fixed Hardpoints. Addi-tionally, these are turrets that can fire in a 360 degree arc, so we add two turreted hardpoints, both with di-rect control mods. We’re up to 9 modifications.<br>
She has a Hyperdrive and Navcomputer, bringing the total modifications to 11.<br>
Finally, the Falcon has exterior protection, so we take the Anti-Boarding System as our 12th mod.<br>
As Han gains credits, he continues to upgrade the ship, eventually installing an Improved Navcomputer modification, two weapon slave arrays to allow firing the turrets from the cockpit, and another fixed hardpoint.</p>

<h3 id="4-choose-equipment"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#4-choose-equipment"></a><a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#4-choose-equipment"></a>4. Choose Equipment</h3>
<p>Starships have access to certain types of equipment. Every starship has access to armor and shields as well as a reactor and a power coupling system, and most have access to weapons. Many starships, especially larger ones, have access to hyperdrives and navcomputers. The <strong>Equipment</strong> chapter provides more information on these categories.</p>
<h4 id="armor-class"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#armor-class"></a><a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#armor-class"></a>Armor Class</h4>
<p>Your <strong>Armor Class</strong> (AC) represents how well your starship avoids being damaged in battle - either my avoiding being hit entirely or by remaining essentially unharmed from an attack. Your AC is determined by three major factors: your base AC, your starship’s Dexterity modifier, and the type of armor your ship has installed.</p>
<p>Your ship has a base AC of 10 (without any plating modifications). You then add (or subtract) the two other factors above: Dexterity modifier, and a bonus or penalty to your ship’s AC based on armor chosen in the <strong>Equipment</strong> chapter.</p>
<h4 id="weapons"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#weapons"></a><a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#weapons"></a>Weapons</h4>
<p>Your ship can have a number of weapons no greater than the number of fixed hardpoints it has. For each fixed hardpoint, a single weapon can be attached. When making attack rolls, or setting the save DC for ship weapons, we use the starship’s Intelligence modifier, and the ship’s proficiently equipped bonus. We also add the ship’s Strength modifier to damage rolls.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 id="building-the-millennium-falcon-step-4"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#building-the-millennium-falcon-step-4"></a><a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#building-the-millennium-falcon-step-4"></a>Building the Millennium Falcon, Step 4</h5>
<p>The Millennium Falcon has a base AC of 10. With a Dexterity of 14, we add 2 to the Millennium Falcon’s base armor class. Additionally, the Falcon comes with deflection armor installed, which we will change out for lightweight armor, further increasing the AC to 14.<br>
The Falcon has two turreted hardpoints, and we choose traditional quad laser cannons to equip to them. When making an attack roll with either weapon, we use the ship’s Intelligence modifier (+1) and the ship’s proficiently equipped bonus (+3). When making a damage roll, we add the ship’s Strength modifier (+2). The fixed hardpoint is equipped with a missile launcher and is loaded with concussion missiles. The missile’s saving throw has a DC equal to 8 plus the ship’s Intelligence modifier (+1) and the ship’s proficiently equipped bonus (+3). We note that the quad laser cannons have an unlimited firing arc, do 2d4 + 3 energy damage, have a range of 800/3200, can fire in rapid mode, and overheat after shooting 8 shots. The concussion missiles have a limited firing arc, do 2d8 + 3 energy damage, have a range of 600/2400 and must fire in either burst 1 or rapid mode. These Falcon can fire 8 missiles before needing to be reloaded, and these missiles have the “explosive” feature, which will force concentration checks by characters on affected ships.</p>

<p>Most Star Wars characters don’t work alone, and while some starships can be operated by a single crew member, it is more dynamic - and engaging - to crew a starship with a <em>party</em> - each member of the party fulfilling a needed role on the ship. Teamwork and cooperation greatly improve your party’s chance to survive the unapologetic lethality of spacefaring.</p>
<h4 id="deployments"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#deployments"></a><a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#deployments"></a>Deployments</h4>
<p>There are six major roles directly tied to the control of a starship: coordinator, gunner, mechanic, operator, pilot, and technician. Any character can have any one or more roles on the ship at any given time, but because there are only some functions a pilot can access, one character must be deployed as the pilot. How your character interacts with your ship - or enemy ships - is determined by what they decide to do on any particular turn, but characters will usually begin to focus on one or two particular roles. The <strong>Deployments</strong> chapter provides more information about each deployment.</p>
<p>The deployment you choose may be the first impactful decision you make when you adopt the space portion of your campaign. Each of the six deployments has a unique and tangible function, and many of them interact - and synergize - with your character’s species and class features. As you progress through the ranks of your chosen deployment, you unlock unique features that augment and enhance your interaction with that deployment, potentially granting you new actions, or simply improving the actions already available to your deployment.</p>
<h4 id="rank"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#rank"></a><a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#rank"></a>Rank</h4>
<p>Typically, a character starts their space journey at deployment rank 0, and advances through the ranks (up to 5th) over time. A rank 0 character is typically inexperienced in the ways of their starship, although he or she might have been on a starship previously.</p>
<p>Starting off at rank 0 marks your character’s entry in the spacefarer life. If you’re already familiar with the game, or if you are joining an existing SW5e campaign, your DM might decide to have you begin at a higher rank, on assumption that your character has already survived a few harrowing adventures. Record your rank on your deployment sheet. If you’re starting at a higher rank, record the additional elements your deployment specialization grants you.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 id="building-the-millennium-falcon-step-5"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#building-the-millennium-falcon-step-5"></a><a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#building-the-millennium-falcon-step-5"></a>Building the Millennium Falcon, Step 5</h5>
<p>A ship is no good without a crew, especially her pilot: Han Solo in this case. Han is a versatile character aboard a ship, but he is strongest in the piloting role (best in the galaxy).<br>
When Han achieves his first rank, we spend that rank in the pilot deployment specialization, unlocking the Piloting Procedure and Venture deployment features. For his Piloting Procedure, we mark that Han’s power dice are d4s. Additionally, Han knows two tactics: for these we choose Koiogran Turn and Snap Roll. For his Venture, we choose Precision Gunner.</p>

<p>As your characters - and their starship - go on adventures and overcome challenges, they can increase in their ranks and tiers, respectively. While tiers are driven by the amount of effort - and credits - directly applied to the starship, ranks are earned separately.</p>
<p>Typically, characters start at deployment rank 0, achieving rank 1 after completing their first successful encounter and earning prestige. The GM may decide, however, that characters start at 1st rank or higher, depending on choices in a character’s background or during an adventure. Higher ranks are achieved by successfully completing more encounters and earning more prestige, as shown below in the <a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#Deployment%20Rank%20Prestige">Deployment Rank Prestige</a> table.</p>
<h5 id="deployment-rank-prestige"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#deployment-rank-prestige"></a><a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#deployment-rank-prestige"></a>Deployment Rank Prestige</h5>

<p>Anything that requires the characters to exercise their skills yields prestige. Defeating, routing, or escaping an encounter are the most common methods, but other actions might yield prestige at the discretion of the GM; completing a training simulation or successfully talking your way out of a situation might earn you prestige, for instance.</p>
<h4 id="beyond-5th-rank"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#beyond-5th-rank"></a><a href="https://sw5e.com/rules/sotg/stepByStep#beyond-5th-rank"></a>Beyond 5th Rank</h4>
<p>Characters who reach 5th rank across their deployments may want to continue progressing in their starship skills. Additional prestige earned can yield additional ranks, though no character can gain higher than 5th rank in any deployment. For each rank beyond 5th, the amount of required prestige increases by 50; achieving 6th rank would require an additional 100 prestige (200 total), while achieving 7th rank would require an additional 150 prestige (350 total).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The expectation is to tie ranks - and hopefully tiers - to proficiency bonuses. When characters reach 5th-level, their proficiency bonus increases to 3, and again at 9th (4), 13th (5), and 17th (6). Ranks 2-4 are designed to be awarded at or around those same improvements.</p>

<p>When your starship gains a tier, it unlocks additional features, depending on its size, as detailed in the description. Some of these features allow you to increase your starship’s ability scores. You can’t increase an ability score above 20 unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p>Each time your starship gains a tier, it gains gain 1 additional Hull Die and 1 additional Shield Die. Roll the Hull Die, add your ship’s Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total to your hull point maximum. Next, roll the Shield Die, add your ship’s Stength modifier to the roll, and add the total to your base shield points which is then multiplied by the appropriate factor depending on which shields your ship has. Alternatively, for both hull and shields, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).</p>
<p>When your ship’s Constitution modifier increases by 1, its hull point maximum increases by 1 for each Hull Die it has. For example, if your tier 0 Medium ship has a Constitution score of 14, when it reaches tier 1, you increases its Constitution score from 14 to 16, thus increasing its Constitution modifier from +2 to +3. At tier 0, your Medium starship has a total of 6 Hull Dice, so its hull point maximum then increases by 6. The same rules apply to your base shield points and your Strength score.</p></div></div><div style="padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px" class="ant-col ant-col-xs-0 ant-col-md-6"><div><div class=""><div class="ant-anchor-wrapper dendron-toc" style="max-height:calc(100vh - 64px);z-index:1"><div class="ant-anchor"><div class="ant-anchor-ink"><span class="ant-anchor-ink-ball"></span></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#chapter-1-step-by-step-starships" title="Chapter 1: Step-By-Step Starships">Chapter 1: Step-By-Step Starships</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#building-the-millennium-falcon" title="Building the Millennium Falcon">Building the Millennium Falcon</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#1-acquire-a-starship" title="1.

When participating in the space portion of the game, your character is impacted by a number of features, including their chosen deployment, the size and style of ship on which they adventure, and the modification and equipment that ship has access to. These choices can enhance and enrich your avatar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore you dive into step 1 below, think about where your adventurer would be most likely to participate in a starship. You might be a dauntless pilot, or a crushing gunner. Perhaps you are a genius mechanic, an intricate operator, or a charming pilot. Maybe you are interested in a mixture of these roles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, what kind of ship, and your intended purpose, can impact these decisions. Do you want to be a soldier in the Imperial Navy, piloting a TIE fighter and leading a squadron? Or are you more inclined to travel as a mercenary aboard a light freighter, taking jobs as you see fit in order to keep your ship in space? Maybe you instead want to be a bounty hunter in an assault craft, tracking your quarry to the Outer Rim, and beyond?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you have an idea in mind, follow these steps in order, making decisions that reflect the character and ship you want. Your conception of your character and starship might evolve with each choice you make. What’s important is that you come to the table with a character you’re excited to play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout this section, we use the term \u003cstrong\u003edeployment sheet\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003estarship sheet\u003c/strong\u003e to mean whatever you use to track your character, whether it’s a formal sheet (like the ones at the end of these rules), some form of digital record, or a piece of notebook paper.

Each size category of starship has unique and tangible features, and determines what kind of crew your starship can support. A Small starship, for instance, can support 1-2 crew members at tier 0, while a Medium starship can support an entire adventuring party.

Any character can have any one or more roles on the ship at any given time, but because there are only some functions a pilot can access, one character must be deployed as the pilot. How your character interacts with your ship - or enemy ships - is determined by what they decide to do on any particular turn, but characters will usually begin to focus on one or two particular roles.

Next, roll the Shield Die, add your ship’s Stength modifier to the roll, and add the total to your base shield points which is then multiplied by the appropriate factor depending on which shields your ship has. Alternatively, for both hull and shields, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen your ship’s Constitution modifier increases by 1, its hull point maximum increases by 1 for each Hull Die it has. For example, if your tier 0 Medium ship has a Constitution score of 14, when it reaches tier 1, you increases its Constitution score from 14 to 16, thus increasing its Constitution modifier from +2 to +3. At tier 0, your Medium starship has a total of 6 Hull Dice, so its hull point maximum then increases by 6. The same rules apply to your base shield points and your Strength score.\u003c/p\u003e","noteIndex":{"id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","title":"Home","desc":"","updated":1677092773137,"created":1631901573363,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"9fe5ffe8639f4d3130538888ddbfc029","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"sessions","alias":"sessions","position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":3,"offset":228},"end":{"line":12,"column":18,"offset":243},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"sessions"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"characters","alias":"characters","position":{"start":{"line":13,"column":3,"offset":246},"end":{"line":13,"column":20,"offset":263},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"characters"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"world","alias":"world","position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":3,"offset":266},"end":{"line":14,"column":15,"offset":278},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"world"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"world.places","alias":"world.places","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":5,"offset":283},"end":{"line":15,"column":24,"offset":302},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"world.places"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"world.factions","alias":"world.factions","position":{"start":{"line":16,"column":5,"offset":307},"end":{"line":16,"column":26,"offset":328},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"world.factions"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"world.objects","alias":"world.objects","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":5,"offset":333},"end":{"line":17,"column":25,"offset":353},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"world.objects"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"world.ships","alias":"world.ships","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":5,"offset":358},"end":{"line":18,"column":23,"offset":376},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"world.ships"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"world.species","alias":"world.species","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":5,"offset":381},"end":{"line":19,"column":25,"offset":401},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"world.species"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"game-references","alias":"game-references","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":3,"offset":404},"end":{"line":20,"column":25,"offset":426},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"game-references"}}],"anchors":{"welcome-to-the-sw5e-wiki":{"type":"header","text":"Welcome to the SW5E Wiki","value":"welcome-to-the-sw5e-wiki","line":10,"column":0,"depth":2},"contents":{"type":"header","text":"Contents","value":"contents","line":16,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["a6lywyt55ekyo90nxi6sowf","67nq8r06mptwrwq2iawcqzs","q47io53e2mozudh6em7birq","wgv3ma9aji1ktnezcty7ibh"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n![](/assets/images/2023-01-08-13-43-38.png)\n\n## Welcome to the SW5E Wiki\n\n- [Home](https://newman174.github.io/sw5e_wiki/)\n- [Github](https://github.com/newman174/sw5e_wiki)\n- [Official Site](https://sw5e.com/)\n\n## Contents\n\n- [[sessions.md]]\n- [[characters.md]]\n- [[world.md]]\n  -
